This steamer is very and most remarkably steady; the service is excellent, filling end il courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if : were so disposed.

After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we real to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with b"skets of fra boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket Was from Celso and Wallace, and n box of chrysanthemums us big as cabbages with see a yard long was from We were an hour late i sailing. and didn't start till twelve.

Dear Cousin T. remarks at intervals what n fine fellow you one, and
painst1Jkin~ly explnins again and again ho'" it happened to:at he did not
recognize you. He is perfectly devoted to Doris and I am tickled :almost
to death. He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd
have a charming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he
wadded!
I do so hope you can find time to go to see Jimmy. Please do if you possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family may grow dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that.
Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Tells? For D. a check for 250 francs to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet article, exquisite soap, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.
Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you. My love to Jack and Wilson Fogs. Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear held.
Your very own

After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we ret to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with b"skets of pro boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves.

Dear Cousin Tn remarks at intervals what n fine fellow you ore, and
painst1Jkin~ly explains again and again ho'" it happened th:at he did not
recognize you. He is perfectly devoted to Doris and I am tickled :almost
to death. He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd
have a charming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he
nodded!
I do so hope you can find time to go to see Jimmy. Please do if you possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family may grow dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that.
Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Tells? For D. a check for 250 france to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite slaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.
Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you. My love to Lock and Wilson Foss. Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear send.
Your very own

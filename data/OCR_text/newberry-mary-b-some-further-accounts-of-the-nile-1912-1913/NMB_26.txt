 
Best Beloved . I regret to say tha t the pin 10rBob Cnmpbell is in my sCllety deposit box at the b"nk ~nd th;:Jt I cannot put my h~'nd on the key. You'll just have to tell him ~bout it, ~nd send it to him later unless the enclosed permit works. It is possible the men 8t the bank can open my box (it's a new one in their new vnults) without my leey. I. think there are two stickpinsï.. The one lor Bob is the greeny≠blue one, not the yellow one. 
Lile drags on here in cloud s ,I nd r"in ,'nd eloom. I love you very much "ndhope you iJre well <lnd h"ppy. Your loving Him.

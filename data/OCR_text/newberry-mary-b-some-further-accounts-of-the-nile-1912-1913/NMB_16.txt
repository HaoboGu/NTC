 
Rest Beloved -Your letter of the 9th has just come and it m~de me weep -I feal so awfully about Crosson Hayes. ~hat a perfe~~ly dreRd≠ful thing to hDve hap~eri. The-thought of What he must-have s~l~'ere~ m~de me feel so sick I didn't want any luncheon, and I'm so low in my m~nd I'm afrfJid this wont be a cheerful letter. 
And now I want to exp1nin why I've ~ritten so m~ch more elaborate letters to Adeline than to you. I kne\\' she \,'as going to miss me more even th;,n you, because she lives such R shut-in life with so few distr"ctions nnd almost no occupations; and so I hvve written those letters to her as full and "S well us my very limited leisure permitted. Then, too, I truly would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fe~r you wouldn't rend them. Very few young men have the pntience to repd long letters. Edward Firth told me that he sometimes cnrried n letter from his mother for a week in his pocket without. reading it. Of course I len0 ,",' you w'ouldn't do th"t, for our rel;ltions \vith e,'en other ,'re quite 
..........' 

different from those of Edward nnd his mother. I'm very fl,∑ttered th,lt you "had 11 ....'onderlul time" rending ;111 th"t m;,nuscript in " bunch. I'm so very sorry you missed thpt lecture by J'.lr. J-lercer, ,'nd ] 
would love to have had you meet him. I never knew him myself, but Ed\ 
u. nd Gr 11ce kne\\' him, 11nd \\'ere therepnrt 0f the time \\'ith him, if I'm 
not mistaken. I wish I knew whether the mines nre paying and wheth ï 
its M:s ï. Twomb~y.who is doing. the mining now that her husband is de:~. The Nlillgan J-!lnlng Co. of WhlCh your uncle is President is the 
"1Ie"','ceml\" Land Jissoci;l tion, und I only \"ish I h/ld some stock in it 
I'm still somewhat 11lme from my rheumlltism, so th~t I've been on m; 
donkey only once in ;:Ilmost three \\'eeks. That \\';:.s lrlst r-10nday ;,nd it 
started up the p~in in my leg agnin so thvt I've hnd to forego ridinp 
since. It makes me wild to miss so much time and lose so many Oppor~l 
nities, but I'm gl~d it's I und not Doris -for the years h,'ve, ,IS thE 
ought, brought something of the philosophic mind to me, nnd I don't mj 
it c!s much as she \\'ould. She; "nd Cousin T. rode'over to the diggines 
this afternoon nnd brought back interesting news. Harry h<ls been ex_ 
cavating a palnce of Rllmeses III vnd has found some very extrnordinnr] ....∑indo\\'s (it "'as not supposed they hfld "'indo"'s in that period) and "lse u couple of bathrooms. I went for a long walk with P sililor to t"ke care of me, -a little too long, for the horne stretch through hepvy 
s;:,nd v;as r,bout nIl I could manelge. 
Just before ....'e arrived in J\fricCl 1 SClid one duy to Doris thut I inu'gir we'd meet so mnny people we knew ∑that the Nile would be like Chnpel S1 She promptly bet me $5 that we wouldn't meet more than three sets of people th"t we kne\\'. She has lost, of course, more th;'n twice over. They've been quite thick recently. Saturday D.m. Doris and Jnnet Dodf cavorted r'bout Kurnuk together, nnd in the c1fternoon I h,ld the Dodge family to tea at the Winter Palace. Sunday after church I had ~ littJ chat "ith }irs. Daniel Euton of Sachem Street, TuesdCly ~l.m. }Irs. E?tor Colme to call; Tuesday Hfternoon th"t nice J-lr. \\'eston (you remember hir first in Kewport and then in Paris) turned up; nnd that night nt the i at the Winter PalHce Doris bostoned most of the evening with Newton ~ and suw the Romeyns. Wednesday I went over to c"ll on the Romeyns, ''1 Mrs. R. must have been really glad to see me because she kissed me. 1 lelt for J\swan the next morning, but we shall see them again in Cniro if not before. I took tea with Mr. Weston Wednesday at the W. P"lpce, He asked a gren t der.l about you and wanted me t\.∑ be sure to giveyouhis ",C!'rmr-eg,trds: He∑hHs been a, full-fl'edged Prof. at \iTiTliflms To'r tl 
ye,t rs now. 
I had already written to Manson & Co. before your letter carne asking them to send you a check for $125. If thn t isn't enough to cover you) Christmas expenses write me ~hat I still owe you. 
We are off on Sllturdny for J\swan. Up to March 20 send letters ns heretofore -Shepheard's, Cairo. After that care Thea. M. Davis, E5~ Messrs. Morgan, Harjes & Co. Paris, France. I

Please give Crosson Hays my love and tell him it is splended to hearl 
of courage like his. I think he is probnbly made of the 5<lme sort of 
stuff as that superb Captain Oates in the South Pole pnrty, who afte ~ 
suffering for weeks without a murmur walked out into the b~izznrd nod 

lost himself so <I S not tabendr 11g up0ntherest. I fee1 fIlm0st as sorry for the unh8ppy fellow whose skate struck Crosson 115 I do for him. It would be so hideous to c~rFY through life the memory of hnvir. done c! thing like that even if it was utterly un1lvoidrtble. I hope you"'on't forget to tell me in your next how he is coming on. 
I shall hnve to give your love to Wndi Halfn, Sugar's successor. I've 
riever set eyes on Sugar since the day long 1.g0 When I got off him 
bouncing and braying on an embankment and vowed I'd not ride him ugnin. 
Good night, my Dnrling. I do get so terribly homesick for you some≠
times thvt I'd give all the pomp and c i rcums ttl nee of Egypt to be b1\ ck

God bless you and keep you.safe. Your loving 1-1im.

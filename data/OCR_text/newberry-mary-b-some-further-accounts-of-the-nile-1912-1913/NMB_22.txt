 
Best Beloved -We are feeling so terribly over the news 
of Charlie Walcott's death which we just heard yesterday. I have 
tha t most despera te of all feelings -the belief tha t someho\<' it m;ght 
have been prevented. This is no reflection on his father, who could 
not drop everything and go with him to California. But if he had hnd 
a mother or his sister to go with him we would not have been subjected 
for so long to what Mr. Walcott himself ~rote me Was "the wrong 
treatment." The one ray of comfort in the whole tragedy is thnt he is 
now with his mother. 

I got your letter of Zarch 20th the other day in Naples, just after I had posted mine to you. And your April 1st one re~ched me here yester≠day. We had to waste one d27 in Naples as it rained so torrentiDl1y~ :J.nc! practically the sale frUit of our stay there ,,"as that Doris sa;\' Pompeii -"'hich "'as one of her heart's desires. 1 ":ould have liked to see it too, for in the 30 years which have elapsed since I wvs there much has been excavated. But it wasn't possible for us both to do it, and I Was cruzy to have D. go. We got here Tuesday night, h~ving left Naples at 9:45 that morning, with Vesuvius covered a third of 
"the wny down from its summit with snow. The cold and the rain here in Italy have been hard to bear after the sunlight and warmth of Egypt. But it is such an entrancing trip here from Naples -such verd~nt count such beautiful vinyards, such a riot of flo'\'ers, the mount<J.ins and hills so splended and so romantic with the feudal towns cro~ning the summits of the foothills and long, long roads leading up to them. On the enclosed ca~d I've marke~ about where our sitting room windo~s 
are, and the br1dge you see 1S the far famed Ponte Vecchio, lined on both sides with the most enthralling shops. Kear the bridge this side of the Ponte Vecchio, and Which just misses getting into the picture, someone wns committing suicide as we drove up to the hotel the night of our arrival.

I'm delighted you had such a nice time with Andrew, und I'm fonder { on, ever of him just because he Was good to you. Your enthusiasm over kii James Kemp makes me think he must have impr6ved very much since I kr to him thirty years ago -which, of course, is time enough for anyone by

Now I must bid you goodnight with a tight hug. Your loving Nother

Entering ~lexandrin Wps one of the most beDutiful things I ever did,≠~nd the scenes on the whnrf -the strnnge tribes nnd peoples, the ~on≠derful colors, the turbans, the fezes, the Turkish trousel's find gold embroidery, the superb fie-ures of the .1I.r;lbs in their long straight robes, the vocifera tions and gesticultl tions, -it \';1 s Hll n m~,d lind wholly deliGhtful confusion. None of us ever hnve to look After u single piece of our forty-something pieces of luggn~e, except one smnll bl~ck bng with Cousin Emma's jewels. Jones nnd ~melie look nfter everything, nnd we simply sail along empty-honded rind tnke possession of comfortable trnin-comportments reserved in lflrge red letters for "Davis Pasho". Cousin Theodore hns been coming to this hotel for 20 years so we are a sort of Roynl Party here and are the recipients of morE salaaming find devotion thnn anything less thnn Royolty often gets. It \\'DS l<Jte Honday evening when we renched here, and we vClnished ;It once in≠the gorgeous suite reserved for us. But the next morning as we were stnnding on the terrace waiting for our motor car, And WAtching monkeys and cobras And mongooses performing on the sidewnlk, who should f~ll upon us from the rear but Mrs. Tonzalin and Charlotte. 
We have been to the museum and hnve seen the wonderful Theodore :H. D;'vis ;Room ""ith all its marvelsand be,)utie5, nnd h;ive been presented (Doris :! . and I) to Sir Gnston Haspero who presented us With the freedom of the Museum, and gave us each D grey find gold permit "de visiter tous les monuments, fermes ou enclos de In Haute-Egypte." We hAve visited our ! dnhabenh, the Beduin, twice and nre wild about it. Once, when the i'. I Elders were napping, Hnrry Burton, D. & I pnid fJ delirious visit to the 
I' nntive bazaars and ~aw more queer things in an hour thnn in ~ll our live :Iput together before. We hrive been to the Pyrnmids!!! (Haven't seen the : ! ~phynx as yet.) We have motored out nnd out into the desert until the whole world seemed made of grey and shifting sand in desol~te sweeps, high ridges and deep hollows. We've been to the Zoo, -one of the nicest ones I ever saw. We've been to the Citadel, ~nd hnve entered the "'onderful }losque of l-lohammed Ali with s,lcred yello,,' slippers :15 big as barges on our proJane tootsies. But after all it is the str~nge nnd crowded and kaleidoscopic street life which is the most enthralling part of Cniro to us so far. Such startling sights which no one but such as we even h,)"n to I 0 ok at. Dori s could ride through C<I iro nn " c::>me1 and not begin to attract the attention she .does in Ne\\' H;'ven ::;n <1 horse. A splendid Arab in v long straight robe of heavenly blue strides ~cross a thoroughfare∑with three dried crocodiles under his arm and 615 Or~nge St. is the only thing that notices him. It's ~11 of it perfectly gorgeous.

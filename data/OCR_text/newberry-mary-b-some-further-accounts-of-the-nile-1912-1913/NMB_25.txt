  
Best Beloved  - It was  a  joyful surprise  to  get  your  letter  
from  Kansas  City,  and  I  hope  mine  to  you  from  Newport  reached  you  

before you left Denver for Leadville. I got back from Newport 
last Tuesday and on Friday went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to 
spend the night with the Taylors. I had positively promised them a 
visit so I had to go. Henry Devereux was,there and we had a nice 
ol~ fashioned Colorado time, and the next day they motored me all the way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the L~wn Club before 
they returned to The Hill. 
Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she Kould wire me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has come, and I'm so an~:ious I've telegr;)phed llrs. BC!.lte::-to '-"sk i! they got there. Kan Eart has sent r.le 2n enlv.rgement of th;! t lo\-ely pictuT'e of D. on horseback with the mountains behind her. It's a perfect beauty and I'm so pleased. I ~,,'ent out to see I:im this afternoon ;lnQ he, too, \\'as a vision o:f bec:.uty in my eyes. He h;!d just been bnthed and he Was a reddish fluff. He almost ate me up, talking hyste~ic~IIy until he \-;c:.s exhous ted and :fIopped fIn t on hi s Iit tIe tu=y on the floor, thumping his tail and rolling the ','hites of his eyes at me. If \,'P' find the bo~~rding home ~,t Castine \-,'ill let us huY,,", }1j_!!'. "'''' pre> gping tp_bave him s~Dt up. 
I hope to get of~ on Wednesday stopping two days at Springfield (or 
rather Blandford near there) with Paige. r.ly accommodations on the boa t from Bo stan are engaged for the night of the 4th. Ca stin, ;';H ine \~ill be our simple address. \\'hen you "'rite tell me every detuil ≠nothing will be too small to interest me. I d~ hope you'll like it. 
Uncle Irank and Aunt Lido. want you to stop and make them a visit in Denver on your way home in C2se they are back there :from the Enst. 
I paid the bill at once. God bless my boy and keep him safe. 
Your loving I:im

Your letter telling o~ ,~11 your Colcrf~do Springs doings and the psa 
you had seen was most interesting. It was revealed to me in n lIps of lightening (truly) during a ferocious and ;.ppolling storm one night th~t I had wholly forgotten to charge you to hunt up M~ggie i Colo. Springs. Hence my costly wire. 
My head is feeling so queer I think I must put it to bed. I'm much too old and too important to work the way I do. Plense hurry up an be a mining King so that I mDy be surrounded by vnss~ls and serfs,

Best Beloved -Something so dreadful lv, s h:.ppenec1 -I Cp bear to tell you. Jones, dear Jones killed himself four nights ngo The Reef. He h~d been having trouble with his her!d ~nd he must gnv gone crazy for the time. He shot himself in the hall outside of hi and the servants found him in the early morning. I think it would killeti Ctli.".lr, Theodore too had he known the whole tr:..:th.?:..:t they him Jones we s very ill and∑ hfld gone home, and the next day they tal him there was no hope, -and then that he Was dend. I have few fri anywhere that I would mourn for more. You have no idea the things did for me last winter -nobody ever in my life took care of me lik that, -and ahrays begging to be allowed to do more. And in all riry I have kno\yn few men as worthy of admiration a.nd affection as Jones 
It seems ~ long time since I heard from you. I hope nothing is the matter. I have postponed going to Ohio till October. 
Endless love, Mother.

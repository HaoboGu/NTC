 
Darling Gopher -We are now wondering whether Edith w~s ~llowed 
to return to Ne\\' He'1.ven for the Prom p-roper. In a letter Doris h;,d from 
Dick he said he hnd met you on the street and you hnd told him of your 

hopes and fears (though he didn't put it that wny.) . I have 11 feeling 
that she did come bnck. I fnncy Mrs. Finch likes now and then to mnke 
a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense. I sh~ll nwait 
your description of the Prom with interest -~ and such patience ~s I 
cnn summon to my aid. It's two weeks since I've hod n letter from you. 
r W(lS rejoiced yesterday by .one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which 

combined the advuntnges of A long-desired missive from ~ friend ~nd ~ ~I puzz.le. She writes one of the most in~ecipher;'ble'h;'nds I've ever :1 ( encountered. It seems Put had fI very ser10US <Jccident in footb~'li ,Ind J a time Was in fl d;'ngerous condition. Th;tt \\'~'s whnt first took her out!1t there. Then she staid for Christm~s, and now she is staying on througl Februnry just becfluse she likesit..

Nothing particulnrly thrilling has happened since my last letter. Thet chi ef destin/I tion 0f 0ur rides for the p Clst \,'eek has been our new digg:: at Nedinet Hobu which is much nearer than the old diggings nt the Tombi of the [(ings. Doris <Jnd I rode over there yesterduy ;,fterooon to chee; Harry up a bit. He occasionally gets tired of not seeing Cl v,'hite pers'( to speak to for days at a time. I sat on a block of stone thvt h"d one been part of a temple pillar, and Doris wandered about picking up chun} of carnelian, and my donkey boy took his clothes off -just ','hy I c;,nn( say. F ortunu tely he pu t them on agr' in. On leaving Harry to hi s d ig/?iJ' we rode up into a hollow in the Libyon Hills to see a temple we hnd ~oi yet visited -a gem of a temple, called Der-el-Medineh. The view nloni off towards the Nile through n wide cleft in the rocks Wns worth gOing' far to see. And the superb looking J\.r;Jb, gunrdi8n of the pl"ce, w;,s S( moved by my present of seven cents thClt he knocked }lahmoud, my donkey 1 out of the wny and held my donkey himself while I mounted. On our homi ward way Doris left me on a maJ g~llop to catch up to a bRby c;,mel she saK in the distnnce. The maternal c;,mel v,'as not ple;,sed by this ;,tten. tion and tried to take (I bite out of Doris, but, happily, failed. 
I've been twice out to luncheon this week -once with the F~hnestocks on their Dahobya "Cheops", and once nt the Winter Palace with the Pier~ The Piers are ench;lnting people and so nice to us. They had Doris ove'f for dinn::r nnd the d~nce aguin Tuesday night. It is 6uch ;, ple;tsure b her and I'm so thnnkful she c<Jn h;,ve it. The incessC'.nt c<'rdpl"ying is r"ther hard on her. I tru to help out by playing dominoes as much ns : can; but Cousin T. so much prefers bridge. 
Give my specinl love to Jack and tell him I live in hopes of finding t: to answer his letter as it deserves. My love to Wilson foss. And, dearest, to please me, bo and callan Mrs. Bnker. It isn't decent not to ,,'hen sh_ehas been so kind <lbout <tsking you there. 
I made a mistake in saying it hnd been h,'o '... eeks since I h;,d <I letter i from you. It's only a little over one. God bless my boy. I hn,e ti~ of being very homesick for you. . 
Your loving }lim.

 Speeding down the Nile 
Best Beloved -At last we are on our homeward say. Of cours~ it is going to take us two months and a half to get there, but four ; ~onths have gohe. ~e left Aswan early Friday morning and r~ached Lu~' 
too late Sunday A.M. for D. and me to go to church. We had expected; 
to come do""n flying, h.aving the current in our favo~, as well <1.S t.; 
tug, but mad winds and many sandbars interrupted our progress. Not 
that D and I minded -it Was interesting to wutch the crew getting u, 
off sandbars. \\r e ~nt 'the rest of Sunday, <I.nd vII of }iond~y and Tue. 
day at Luxor, tied up as nearly as possible in our old piace, and Wi, 
notbing very exciting doing. Doris paid one final visit to Karnak

Sunday afte~noon, and on Monday she and Cousin Theodore took their last ride on Julius Caesar and Hermes, -while I hod to do the society act for the family, going out to suy goodbye to the teachers at the American mission school, and then taking a farewell tea with the Corlessa. That last was quite unnecessary because she left Luxor just as '~e did, yesterday and ''''e are all to meet in Cniro. But the poor lady had been ill in bed and was lonely -and I always like to see her. Tuesday Doris and Cousin Emma went over to Luxor early in the morning and I played dominoes. Harry came over from the Valley and spent most of the day. The diggings have stopped (this is the seuson for stopping them) and Harry \vill join us in Cairo, going down by train in about ten days when he has done the final settling up of ever~thing in the Valley. Nr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our discoveries are the only important ones made this winter at Thebes. 
LaDcelot Crane came to tea that afternoon and he and Harry and D and 1 can ~lways amuse ourselves vaitly talking to each other. Some ladies Cou sin Emma kne".' al so came. And pre sen tl y Grane and Harry mounted their donkeys and with a wave of their hats turned towards the valley. 
lIe left Luxor shortly after eleven, I think, yesterday morning and it ~as gectic getting off. The sands were dotted with natives who had come to say goodbye, and get a parting bnckshish, and on the Luxor side, as we pnssed, tradesmen whom we had patronized, and many friends of the crew waved frantically at us. We have come skiMoing down thus far -and oh these lovely banks! They are covered with poppies now in long stretches. We got to Dendereh yenterday afternoon about five and stopped for Doris and me to see thAt temple. Jones said it \"as a very Iittle '.;alk. "A Iittle wCI.lktt in this family means not more than n ten-minute one, so we started on foot. But it had been some years since Jones had done it and he had forgotten. It WDS almost, if not quite, two miles there, which wouldn't have mattered in the least if it hudn't been so late. T'\\'o sailors 'vere sent With us, and we walked us fast as we could, but we only got there in time to see the sunset from the roof-Which alone was worth the expedition, and then fairly tore through the dim recesses of the temple and down into the mbst_umazing crypt. It was so spooky there that it Was com≠forting to think that the Gaffir -having seen our <1thletic gu,.rdi'lns at the gates o~ the temple -would not dare to murder us as he so easily might. It w.ts a 1,'onderful walk back -qui te recompensing us for the calling do','n that a"'v.ited us. The relatives h;ld grown frightened about our being out 8~ter dark, and ~ere cross in conse≠quence. Of course it was Jones who out to have been called dow -but considering all Jones does for us I'd always rather take ~ scolding than have him get one. We started out with an escort of two s~ilors, ~nd we. CRme back with four sailors (two more having been sent out to meet us) b,o n,ltive men ";ho hud attached tbemselves to the p,'rty, 
h:o children nnd b>o go∑uts.

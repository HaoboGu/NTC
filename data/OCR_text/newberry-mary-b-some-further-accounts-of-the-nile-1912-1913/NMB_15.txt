This is an extract from your grandmother's last letter. If you stopped to think for one minute how such breaches of ordinary good manners mortify me (ac~unlly to the point of sufferi.ng) I'm sure you would not again neglect to acknowledge a present or answer an invitation. Ple~se write now to both Nother and Mabel. The latter's address is 
Mrs. H. W. Buttolph

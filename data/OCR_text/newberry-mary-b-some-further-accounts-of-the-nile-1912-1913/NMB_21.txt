Best Beloved -Jones has just informed me that unless I get my letters off at 2:30 this afternoon they won't go for three days. It is now 12:30 and luncheon in half an hour. So this must be dashed off at a gallop. Oh my dear! that camel expedition on Monday was the most wonderful thing I ev~r did. Of course I was horribly lame for 2 days afterwards, but so were Harry an~ Doris. Yc would have adored it, -I'd have given anything to have had you alon/ They weren't awfully good camels either~ so I can imagine the rapture of riding fine ones. Harry went off the other day on an expedition with some English people one of whom was the Major of a Highland regiment. Said Major furnished the camels from the coestguard corps and H'arry ,said they "'ere perfectly 'superb, and much much easier to r: than the ones we had. . . 
We've haunted bazaars and done errands and had some swagger clothes made (for which your uncle insisted on paying; -but we wouldn't havi had them otherWise), and had visitors and ~one to teas, and revelled 
in street sights, and I've seen the hnedive and almost seen Lord Kitchener but not quite, and have met one of the highest-up men in tJ Army here -Major ~atson, or Watson Pasha -whichever you choose to 
call him, who is aide-de-camp to the Ehedive. He is an enchanting person and if he weren't already married I should try to get him for Little Sister. 
We are sailing Wednesday so my next letter will be from Naples where we expect to spend two days, going thence to Florence. No letter 
from you since 2 '" eeks ago. Hor;~' all goes wel.1 ,,'ith you. Endless 
love from ..., Your }.jim

Best Beloved. We left Cairo yesterday morning at 9:45 and re~che~ Alexandria at one after a comfortable trip through such lovely scene~ I couldn't bear to take my eyes off the windows for a minute. We I sailed at 2:30 and are due in Naples at 11 A.M. Saturday. If we Dret not late and if the day is pleasant (it's funny I remembered to say t that after four months of pleasant dnys as a matter of course) Herrt is going to take Doris -and me if I can get off ~ to Pompeii. And' Sunday Cousin T. is planning to take us on a marvellous motor trip D~ 

the coast of Amalfi. Monday we shall probably proceed upon our way to Florence. Before leaving Cairo we managed to work in a little luOre s~gnLseeing. We saw a mosque -the second largest in the world, and quite beautiful. It contains two objects of particul~r interest â‰ a granite column that came there all by itself from }lecca, and a mdgic stone which When people have violent tummy aches they go and lick until their tongues bleed. Quite a deep hollow had been licked in it, and the blood stnins on the base were very revolting. We also went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which form a sort of Stately City of the Dead with superb domes and exquisite minare~s, on the outskirts of the City proper and close to the desert. Doris and I would have given our eyeteeth for one untrammeled "'eek in Cairo. There ~Ire such wonderful things to see and do there nnd we missed so mnny of them through no fault of ours. 
I do so hope to find a letter from you in Naples forwarded from Poris. 
It seems very long since I heard. 
Your loving, loving Mim.

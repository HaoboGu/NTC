The principal thing that hns occurred since my lnst \\'eek's letter to 	1I

WSaturdwy morning we <111 proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin 1: mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves! de his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair cnrri. CiT bvtwomenBndD. & I on foot. It wns a sensation of ~ lifetime to I Tl visit that place for the fi~st time. A number of tombs are open to t~ s: public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his dei tl 3ut Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the vnlleYi . s'it ...∑as amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gClping tourists <.nd dis:1pp ". into an opening labelled "Ro Admi ttance" from ""hich ....∑ere issuing clouq ..: of dust and n procession of children cr1rrying dirt elnd rocks in brIsket b which they empti~d on a dump. Nost of the manunl l~bor in excnvntionl ". in this region is done by children and I hate it. They ~re urged on I overseers with Whips. But our overseer was deprived of his Whip Inst <:> year "'hen Harry saW him cut a piece out of a boy's leg "'ith the lpsh. i p 
t 
Tiine-faits to tell∑ you of the marvels of the tombs \\'e .-s<l.\.... That .Hfter≠noon I took a ,,'alk <tlone and climbed a ridge and ,,'ent down into r.noth valley and up on the ridge beyond. And the sun went down, and withou sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saW. The silence was d ful, and I was suddenly siezed With a horror of the desert and fled ~ 
to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off by myself. Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our too ties explor 
the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why elll the kings didn' make their tombs there I cannot understand. It is the most regal, 
stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saW. 
Cousin Emma and I CrIme home to the Dah.,by.∑ !'londny morning rind gl<>d enough we were to get here. But Cousin Theodore and Doris -tnrried ti yesterd<ty. He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it. But it would get on nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations Rnd were replly livin there.

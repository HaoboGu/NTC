 
Best Beloved -Here \,'e tIre vgl\in, helving finished the voyage down the river Thu~sday morning. Said voyage ~as more or Ie spoiled by the incessant winds which made sitting on deck disagree~ and uncomfortable; and sitt~ng on deck is the main point to :~ trip on the Nile. Our running onto the numerous sandbars which now impe navigation in the present low state of the river Doris and I regard as interesting. It was so amusing watching the men get us off. Wednesday morning we sat on a sandbar for an hour in company with 2 large steamers, i small steamer and 27 netive boats! 
~e are to stay on the boat until a week from today when we move to 
Ghezireh Palace. This may sound as though we were to visit the l\.nedive, but it's merely an hotel \~here a hnedivi,l.l pC!.lace used to and which is run by the same management as Shepheurd's. Being on a 
island in the river it is pleasanter at this time of year than Sher 
heard's III 
Yesterday, being Good Friday, I went to church. Doris d{ddt feel well so I went alone in the huge red motor car. The cburch WaS ful and many, many men "'ere there. That's one .. of the fire things about Englishmen -they stand steadfastly by the training of their youth~ in the matter of churchgoing. Coming out I stopped for a moment tc look at the plain little tablet set in the hall at the end of the church in memory of that great hero Gordon. Outside the door I found l'li's. Romeyn and Emma \∑.'ai ting for me. 
Your letter of the 6th has just come and I'm cuttin~ this short in∑ order to catch tonight's mail and let you know at once our plans n as I know them. I can't understand how I've failed to do it befor We sail from Alexandria April 9th, arrive in Florence probnbly tbe 
stay about a week there, then go to Venice lor about a week; then

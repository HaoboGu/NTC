Best Beloved -As Doris wrote you early in the ~eek I post≠poned my writing. We moved to this hotel Friday and were glad to get a~ay from the dD.ha bya on ac count of the hea t ','hi ch wa s grov.:ing too great on the river. It's much cooler here. The rooms are perfectly gigantic -truly palatial. There's a nice garden to walk or sit in. 
But I have a confused feeling, -my room is so big I can't find any of' 
my things without hunting allover the place. I feel that we are "asting opportunities here but we can't help ourselves. I've done only 
two things worth doing since last Sunday. One of them Was the Torch≠
light Tattob Tuesday evening on Kasr ~i Nil Barrncks Ground. It Was a 
very fine spectacle, -quite thrilling:to see issuing forth from a∑ grea t door\\'a.y t\\'o hundred Gordon Highlanders each carrying f.l torch. They marched and evoluted in lines of iight; and finally took their 
stand outlining three sides of a tremendous hollo~ square in ~hich nIl 
the performances took place. 
The ether worth-while incident of the week was spending a couple of hours in the museum \{ednesday morning and seeing the wonders there in the new light of my recently acquired learning in Egyptology. For the rest I've gone to dressmakers and done errands, and taken little drives to nowhere and played many games of dominoes. This morning Harry Burton and I w~nt.to church while Doris staid on duty, and this after≠noon I staid while Doris and Harry went to the Zoo. They had a fascina≠ting time and saw ,many en~hanting sights -baby lions and baby giraffes and .a.~ip'po. th<J,.-t c;;amE' when itwas called and op-=:ned and shut, -att-he bidding of its keeper. the cavern it calls its mouth; and a baby ele≠pha.~t marching at the heud of a company of Scotch pipers; and they hRd their tea ona tiny island in a little lake Where they were surrounded by pelicnns and flamingoes. 
Tomorrow we go to Sakkara. on camels -a 16 mile ride in all. I'm doing 
it out of pure bravado because Doris thinks I can't. "Mother you're 
crazy: And Roger wouldn't allow it for a minute if he were here." But 
you are no there, are you darling? Ala s: tha t you a re no t: And I kno\\' 
you like your mother to be a true sport. Harry and Doris and I and a 
Lady Hilda something to whom we have talked several times, and who is 
who is cutting a~l kinds of engagements tomorrow to go with us. 
Goodnight my own dear boy. God bless you and keep you safe. 
Your loving

 
Darling Gopher -Doris and I went nshore at Asyut, under the escort of Bareem to take a drive through the city. The Beduin could not get close to the shore so we were landed in the feluccn with six Nubians rowing it with a man-of-war's-men precision. We lnnded at the foot 01 steep, high bank done in rough masonry, and before I had time to wondE how on earth l was to climb it I found ~yself at the topï.A trusty mariner at each elbow had wafted me thither. There's never the slight fuss, -a nod, a single word from the person in command and the thing done as if by magic. It was the same when we returned from our ~syut: spree. The Beduin and the felucca had moved up the streHm to R spot t even the felucca couldn't make n landing. ~ word from Hareem <Jnd D. r I were picked up deftly, carried through the water and set down gentl~ into the bovt. It was market day in Asyut and the entire popul tion was ~pparently in the streets. We drove through the bazanr ~nd j market where men, women, children, bulls, camels, donkeys were in one! grand mass. It is a large, important, rich town, with many elabornte; houses belonging to natives, and during our entire drive we snw~ not J single white person. 
In spite of the delights in store for us I hote to have this he~venl voyage end. To all the enchnntments of the shores have Intely been added the most wonderful flocks of birds. The Sister-Kittie :Innounce yesterda.y when we joined her on deck that a flight of at ieast a 
thousand crnnes had passed overhend, and not nIl our efforts could m, 
her come down one crnne.I myself counted sixty-two pelicans sitting on a sandbnr. And today we soiled by close to Kasz-es-Snynd ("the Hunter's Cnstle")~ nnd What easily might be n castle is nothing more hor less that u colossol pigeon-house. Hundreds of thousands of pigeong were perching on the battlements or flying about the~, nnd little flocks ~ere hastening home to them from all directions. They nre bred in this land ns much for their droppings, which make n much-prized fertilizer, as for food. (That's u horrid sounding sentence but you will understand What I menn). On the West bank of the river, opposite the Hunter's Castle, is the little town of Hou where for 53 years Shieck Selim sat stark naked on the bank of the Nile. He died a few years ago, and they built a tomb on his sitting place to Which the natives mnke pilgrimages. Clothes seem rather lightly esteemed in Egypt. If the doy is Warm the Shaduf workers wenr practically the same garb as the Ap~che Indinn, nnd their beautiful bodies look like bronze. We were p~ssing quite close to the shore when a gentleman bounded down the banks, yanked off his one and only garment and proceeded to do is laundry work in the Nile. 
Sunday -22nd December. The Beduin, Luxor. At noon yesterday ≠and a day soaked in sunshine -we came in sight of Luxor, and n short time thereafter hAd reached its outskirts, and from the window of a dnhabyo tied to the east bnnk the plensapt, tousled he~d of Nicole, nn English artist, bowed and called greetings to Cousin Theodore. Past some charming looking hotels we slipped, catching glimpses in between of the most beautiful columns of the Temple of Luxor, past the Winter Palace Hotel, and then diagonally across the rive to our mooring place on the west shore. We have it all to ourselves at present, the other boats preferring to be in the thick of every thin on the east bank. But we have n beautiful sandy beach on which the crew have pitched their tent, and where we instantly established the poultry yard. The three coops were taken from the dahabyn put on the sand nnd opened. Sir Francis Drvke ~nd his three Indies waddled mndly for the b~nk, slid down it on their tails ond launched themselves joyously upon the water. The 
White Cock stepped daintily forth, lonely but still g~llnnt. All tis \;'ives were eaten on the \yay up. But seldom are w!i.do\,'ers so soon con≠soled -by 9 a.m. teday he had three more. The turkey cock nnd his consort emerged frOID their coop so stiff they could ha:rdl.y stnnd up. But they were soon limbered, an~ the gobbler strutted ~nd rustled nnd gobbled as though he owned the earth. 
But Oh my dear! if you could see wha t 1 i e s beyond our ben ch! A gre~ t plain with stretches of sand and stretches of lovely green, and clumps of trees, and then the fierce and glaring nnd benutiful Lybian mountnins making a mighty wall beyond. I CAnnot give you any idea of how wonder≠ful it is. I could hnve spent the whole nfternoon looking, but I sudden≠ly went wild with neuralgia in my fnce ond took to my bed and suffered torments for hours, and then -as suddenly -the pain l~ft ond I slept Dll night, and got up this mbrning ready for ~nything. I Wanted to go to church this a.m. but Cousin Emma objected as my fnce Was still swollen and she snid~fhe church was always cold. 
This afternoon when Cousin Theodore had hod his nop, he, Doris, I Rnd Jones, all in Our riding clothes, w~re rowed across the river in the felucca. Our donkeys "'ere aWaiting us in front of the \\Tinter Pal.;ce, the donkey boys (old retainers) kissed Our hands and off we stnrted fo~ Karnak. We could only take a most cursory look at thos stupendous 
ruins -actu~lly inconceivable until you stnnd in their'presence.

Dctrling Gopher This letter is some",hClt belated and I'rlJ. sorry.':! We left Florence Monday afternoon, April 28th at five in the Clftern¢ I and reached here Tuesday night at quarter of eleven; and dearly as ~ Er love England I am now getting so imp"tient to be home that I have a~ co constant pushing feeling inside of myself. On the SundCly before le;i sn ing Flo rence I ,,' ent to the Ameri can Church and encoun te red the Iiomej( He and we wal~ed home together. D. and I also ran across them the.nex I Ie 
morning when "'e were paying a final visit to the beauties contu1~e~ tÄ in the church of Santa Croce. Mrs. Romeyn Was full of Rad's nob~l~ in sticking to his job instead of accepting her invitation for h1m come to Europe for the summer. 

I∑ 
! 
]∑lr. R. observed that nadcliffe ,,'us not fond of Europe: "But he is fond of his family" I said. "Oh: he likes his mother" said 1'1r. 
R. -"but not me:" I never have been able to make }∑jr. R. out: 
\'le saw Helen Wolcott again, -she came to see us; nnd I hnd from 1-1r. 
Walcott one of the most desperately p9thetic letters I ever rend. 
The sense of Charlie's loss grows continually greater with me, und the 
rose color has faded out of everything. One of the very first thinÄs 
I meant to do on getting home Was to go to see him, and it makes my 
heart heavy to think that the utmost I can ever do now is to go ond 
put some flowers on his grave. 

As in Italy so also here -we motor and motor and motor. It's for≠tunate that both D. and I are so fond of it. Here we hnve one of the finest cars I've ever ridden in; -but it's always a limosine which destroys ::;()Ioe of the pleasure. Today we've been to St. Albans -8 magnificent cathedral, the largest, I'm told, in England, and built on the site where the first martyrdom to Christianity took place in England. As eousinT. ~8S WRiting for us outside we didn't h~lf see it, but the drive there and back was lovely. 
I got your letter, telling of your visit to Kim and that you thought of goine to Sonopah with Fred Brown, ju~t before leaving Floren~e. Would that I, too, might go to Sonopah. 
The:-Bakers seem to have been very kind about inviting you to meals. I hope you have called spontaneously at least once. If not plense do it before we get home. I don't want my rapture at being with you once again marred by finding you've been rude to people who h~ve been kind to you. Also it will be more in keeping With your self respect 
to go by yourself than to be dragged there by the seat of your trou by an irnte ~im. Oh Deerest how good it will be to see you again: 
God keep you safe. Your loving l"lim.

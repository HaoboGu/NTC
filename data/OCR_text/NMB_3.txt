 

Darling Gopher -The day we got to Naples Wns simply henvenly. I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel. Also I posted 23 other letters and notes that I'd written on the steamer. As we were driving from the steamer to our hostelry, the Grand Hotel, Doris and I grinning with delight over everything we saw, our c~rri~ge was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whi ttaker. I think I told you on my post card from Naples thnt Jim came all the way from Florence to meet us. And Giulio Tedeschi sent word that he would have given his sou to come also, but couldn't leave his sick mother. We had a perfect time tha t first day -it \Ul s so beCl u tiful, and I'm wondering \vhy I hel ted Naples so that long ago time when I w~s a girl. 
Afte~ w~ ~~d ~een our quarters at the hotel, we nIl, except Connie E., w~nt drlvln? al~ng a wonderful mountain ro~d "bove the city to Posolippo, w1th ecstntlc.vlews. In the afternoon while naps were being t~ken by the Elders, J1ID nnd Doris nnd I went to the ~qu"rium, stopping on our Wny ~y t~e se~wnll ~o see a lot of fishermen drawing in R seine. They did

The next dny "'~IS hal' we~ther ond the only thing of interest that we did WllS the museum, to which Jim and Doris and I went in the morning. But there is never≠failing amusement from the windows of the Grand, which is close to

the wuter, with n constant drilling of soldiers in the street by dRy, and minstrelsy by night.

Ke boarded this ste;Jmer at about 10:)0 "Fridvy A.H. in the midst of thel wildest confusion (I fancy it's alw;Jys that W8Y in this voluble ,tnd ! excitable land). Jim came down to say goodbye ~nd then betook himselr! to his train. We were to have sailed at 12 but were two hours late ! because of a gruesome accident. They were lowering a huge b~le of I sacks of potatoes into the hold when it escaped n guiding hand nnd smashed a poor mnn to death against the side of the steomer.

!Is we sailed out pnst Capri nnd the coast of Italy unfolded "where the: Waves and mountains meet", it was a sight of brenthless beuuty. We I were, unfortunately, asleep when we pRssed through the Straits of Mes~ Today we have had D dim, dim glimpse of Crete, and it's getting delicil ously wnrm. We are due in Alexandria about noon tomorrow, and should be in Cairo in time for dinner. Harry Burton is too nmusing for words, He is a most delightful addition to our party. I only wish he were going to live on the d~habeah instead of up in the Valley. All blesSil on your dear hend. I think you ought to give something to some poor j person for Christmas; -a turkey sent to Hrs. Tornberg, 90 Wolcott St'j would be a chnrity indeed Rnd could be ordered before you leave for 
Clevelnnd. 
I thought of you at Pomfret Thanksgiving Day. It was h~rd to re~lizei in Naples, (With nothing at all to mark the d~y except the m~ny, m~ny' things we have to be thankful for), that in our native l~nd, Turkey jl and Cranberry were reigning supreme. 
I I  meant must,  to in  stop this letter on the last sheet with my order to \vri te to your grandmo there  benediction.  N . I  
Your  loving,  loving  
Him.  

Please write to your grandmother at Christmas time. It's possible sh: may be in Indianapolis at the time, but "Gambier, Ohio" will always reach her.

 
Darling Gopher -The nicest things that hnppened to me today were receipt of your letter of Dec. 7, and the fact that Emily Morgan spent a little pnrt of the day with us. Those two things kept me from whollj 'succumbinR to homesickness. I felt its touch on my shoulder, so to spe all day long. The Serapis and Mr. Tuck and his party, of which Emily ~ Miss Kelson are two-ninths, came down from Aswan yesterday. They wave~ from the deck as they steamed by us, and soon after luncheon we went 0\ to the Serapis to call. Emily is certainly one of the sweetest things 
all the world. I was as glad to see her 115 if she were my very own. 
I hung up my stocking as I've never missed doing, but the Sister-KittiE refused to indulge in what she seemed to consider nn empty form withoui a chimney piece to hang them by. Cousin Theodore gave us his presents in Cairo -a pearl and diamond ring to Doris~ and n stunning gold mesh purse to me. Driris g~ve me ,I beautiful red linen cover with embroidery fer my table; Cousin Emma gave me an'inl:.id sand::l\"ood box, _ Dick B8ker gave me nnother one. (Doris \-iOS his agent). The Hitchell ladies, ~:rs Hoppin a.nd Aunt 1'-1nbel had all sent me pack;lges to bring ov with me. Jones gave Doris and me ea.ch a little silve~ . seal With our ;I initials in Arabic engr~ved on it. ~e were much touched by this gift.; And l-lohnmmed !∑luhnssef, the best kno\,'n and most reli,.ble antiquity de.al~ here, sent D. & me each a. scarab. Cousin T. has hnd mnnv denlins with~ so every Christmas he sends n present to each member of ~ousin T's pprl After the breakfast things were cleared from the table, the ceremony 01 giving the crew their presents took place. Cousin T. & Cousin E. sat I the table, D. & I on the divan, a.nd Jones w~s master of ceremonies. T cre\,' and,inside servvnts cnme in one by one, kissed our h:lnds, s:lid "Kulle sana \~'inta tCliyih" (A Happy Ney.. Year to you), ;lnd eclch receiv a "'h~ te sbcJ.\'J'1 a box of c i ga re t te s, f.l b;, g ~th cundy Q.nd nu t s ;1 nd some 
money, Rna de~nrted beamJ.ng. ~hen they all liad h?5 their pr~sents the 
ga thered on the de ck Cl nd shou ted "Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooray! T' ;. nk you, 
t'nnk you, t'ank you", and we retired to our several Ap:lrtments and 
wnshed our hands in dioxygen. ' 

hen the feluccn took Doris nnd me across the river, Rnd HRrry Burton 
'et usnt the steps (he i s 50ppingat the \Hntel' Pn Ince, thel'e being no 
Oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church ~hich 
s awny ut the renr of a garden filled with p;J!ms nnd :IC;ICi:l5 lind other 
ovell' things, nnd where an Arnb was ringing the bell outside, tiS they did 
n "Bunty". And Emily joined us inside. It ..... as very cpmforting to me 

o have her to go to church with us this far lund on this Dny of Dnys. 
hen we c<Jme back to the Beduin \"e brought Harry :lnd Hr. Crane (11 young 
nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crnne) to luncheon. 
fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymknna in the Winter Palpce 

;ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for ten so we couldn't. The 
'ucks came nnd Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were 
razy about the boat, nnd we hnd u lovely time. They go on their wny to 
:airo tomorrow at one. ~e had such a perfectly enormous 

inner tonight with only the four of us to ent it thnt by the time the 
:urkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, vnd h"ve it c:trried 
,ff unscathed, for we had to eot plum pudding. Jones h~ving heard me 
"emnrk that I wns going to break over my total abstinence on Christmns in 
Irder to drink a toast to you, had supplied ch"mpa~ne from the wine 
:ell~;, wherever that may be. The Cousins never touch charnpngne, so 
loris and I drnnk alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank n 
:omprehensive toast to "all the people I love". 

'e hnd a splendid ,m"il awaiting us when we got bock from church this 
Borning. It was so good to have it come on Christmns Dny. I do hope 
TOU got my first letter very soon after you sent yours. I think I ex≠)1 v inedinitth;1t pe 0pIe told uson no acc 0unt top0stIettel's n t Gibï 
Jecnuse it sometimes took months for them to re~ch their destinntions froJ 
there. So I only mailed you a postenI'd from there & sent my first letter 
~rom Naples the minute we landed on the 27th. 

Jec. 26th. Doris and I mounted on our gnllont donkeys, (mine is n:Jmed 3ugn r) and followed by our donkey boy s (mine is no med }jahmoud) rod e off this morning towards the Liby~n mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi -see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot. fhe figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, mnking the entire height 65 ft. ~ven in this land of mighty marvels they seem all that there is of the ~(traordinnry. Well, deorest, dozens of other letters must be Nritten, sofureth'ee well for now. 
Endless love ~nd many blessings on your belove head. Your very o'l'"n !-'iim

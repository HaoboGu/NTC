 
Darling Gopher -Your letter of the 8th arrived tod~y, -fift days is pretty quick work, the quickest possible I fancy. I w~s ~wf glad to get it, and I am also glad to be able to tell you that i~s qUite all right with Mr. Eells as well as with Mrs., for I had n fir 
~~ng lelLer from him on Sunday expressing much disnppointment, but r traces of annoynnce aty~urfDilure to come to Cleveland. He is so sensitive I WHS afraid he might think you ~ent to Snvnnnnhmerely bE CRuse you preferred to. Congratulc1tions on having p~ssed your ex~m~ also on hnving done the nice thing at Christmas by Nnn, and others j your grandmother. By the way, did you really -CIS metn to mnn, mind. like your waistcoat? Doris and I had an argument over it. She mnil you would think it vulgarly loud, while I insisted that there w~s n( in getting a fnncy waistcoat unless it ..... as fancy, and I thought it , go very well with the Oxford grey clothes I made you get. Bud Tnlb' had alrendy, in n letter to we, broken the horrid news about Lefty Cloister has certainly got D black eye this Winter, nicht wnhr? 
V<>rious exciting things have happened " a ll in the blue, unclouded W since my last letter. On Sunday Doris and Cousin T., mounted on th donkeys and accompanied by the peerless Jones, bnsely deserted Cous 
,I 
-Emma and me Bnd trotted over to the Vnlley to spend the night' while we∑ had to sit tamely on deck like perCect ladies, and dispense ten "nd ;. cukes to str;lnge /\meric,lns Crom BuCf;.lo ....'hom we had never seen before. Sir Gaston Haspero W8S to join them the next morning at the Tombs ~nd pronounce judgement on the red granite snrcophagus. The next afternoon I hnd just got bnck from a long walk (nccompanied by n sailor with ~ heavy stick,) packed With Clens which I had nnnexed in a native village I sUddenly found myself in; and Was having ten on deck in company with thl Can te s sa Con t<J rdone (I nd Nr. Tremaine when the CH V;, I cn de re turned from the Valley. It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning from the Africnn desert as they Cnme in single file ocross the sAnds; fir the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris & Jones with the donkey boys running beside the~, and Julius C~esnr brny≠ing his head off as they cnme. Doris Was benming. She had hnd the most wonderful time with Maspero who had lunched with them in the House in the Valley and who talked (IS she never had heard nnyon~ t(llk before. He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in Cairo, but also Wclnts Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of 250 poinds sterling for its transportation there: 
The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next dc1y n t the 
great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of n noted 
Arab snoke-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the 
purpose. \vewent, and it ,~as an extraordinary experience. (Doris h"d 
a nasty spill on the w(ly out. Her donkey itepped into n pitfnll~ flung 
her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, with 
her usual plucX, and in the end suffered no serious eCfects). I simply 
h'lven't time to give you an account of '''hat happened at the ruins. It 
was both drnmntic nnd astounding. The Arab stalking in front of the 
picnic l who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incnntntion in 
a loud clear voice, nn~ lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the 
desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple w~ll. 

Yesterday I pl~yed in a tennis tournament at the Winter P~luce ond 
carried off a cup (the 1st Prize),-not by my own prowess but by that 
of my pnrtner, Cl very nice Scotchman nn.med HllcNaughton who plClyed ;l 
corking gnme. 

_Jhis afternoon D. & I went over there ngnin on invitnti0n to ,,,;,tch ;1 ra ther mild but quite flmUS ing gymkha na, ,'nd en joyed ourselve s immensely. And now I must turn in Hnd get some of that sleep thnt I seem to requir-e more here thun anywhere else in the world. I suppose now you cannot get that operation done till the Spring vacCltion. I wonder if postponing it ~as wise. 
Oceans of love, 	dearest, from Your l-lim.

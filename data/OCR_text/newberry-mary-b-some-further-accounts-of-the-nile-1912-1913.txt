Dar1ing Gopher -This v0yage isalm0st 0ver; -\I'e ~ redue i n ]X ~ 
in the morning at the crude hour of siX, though we don't h~ve to ge 
until considerably later. But, presum~bly, there will be bumpings 
hDngings and yel1ings from five on so that sleep will be wooed in v The vOyRge has been a good one as voyages go. This stenmer is very and most remarknbly steady; the service is excellent, ~illing ~nd ml courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if : were so disposed. The menus have included everything the plain Arne) has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never henrc 
from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dilled cucumber." 
After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we ret~ to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with b"skets of fru boxes of fl~wers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket Was from Nelso and Wallace, and n box of chrysanthemums us big as cabbages with ste a yard long was from We were nn hour late i sailiD~. and didn't start till twelve. 
Our one disappointment Wns the thick we~ther ~hich prevented GU~ h~v anything more than very unsatisfnctory glimpses of the Azores. But Oh:~Gibraltar: The Sister-Kitty says she has ~ritten you all Rbout 
but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you more thnn a fRint id of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of th~t wonderful spot. We did so hanker for you, and Jones w~s the first to sav it aloud! how much he wished you were theT~ 
Yes t erd CtY v ur firs t day. inthe Medi t errnnean was pel∑fee t.L Y [j E: " utir u1 a smooth pale blue sea, and the splendid almost sinister co~st of Af: very ne~r, with mountains so high there Wns snow upon their summits. was after dark when we anchored before Algiers last evening ~nd Cous~ Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peer≠less Jones. t1They are everyone of them beasts in that town" he said shortly, ."The re 's no kno,,",' ing ,"'ha t they might say to you". "Not with me there, sir," said Jones. But he \\'ouldn't let us go. However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in ; moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely pRcked buildings J ing to the crest of the hill wus R lovely spectacle from the deck of ship. Today the Mediterranean hns been too choppy for perfect be~ut~ but we've had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky mount, ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits. B~edecker says brieflY that 
"public safety is not guarrRnteed to travellers in Sa~diniB."

Dear Cousin T. remarks at interv~ls whnt n fine fellow you ore, nnd 
painst1Jkin~ly explnins nguin nnd oguin ho'" it hnppened th:.t he did not 
recognize you. He is perfectly devoted to Doris nnd I am tickled :.lmost 
to death. He said the other duy that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd 
have a chnrming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he 
cJdded! 
I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy. Please do if you possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family m~y grow dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that. 
Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells? For D. a check for 250 francs to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc. 
Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will rench you. My love to Jock and Wilson Foss. Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear hend.

Darling Gopher -The day we got to Naples Wns simply henvenly. I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel. Also I posted 23 other letters and notes that I'd written on the steamer. As we were driving from the steamer to our hostelry, the Grand Hotel, Doris and I grinning with delight over everything we saw, our c~rri~ge was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whi ttaker. I think I told you on my post card from Naples thnt Jim came all the way from Florence to meet us. And Giulio Tedeschi sent word that he would have given his sou to come also, but couldn't leave his sick mother. We had a perfect time tha t first day -it \Ul s so beCl u tiful, and I'm wondering \vhy I hel ted Naples so that long ago time when I w~s a girl.

Cousin Theodore hns been coming to this hotel for 20 years so we are a sort of Roynl Party here and are the recipients of morE salaaming find devotion thnn anything less thnn Royolty often gets.

We have motored out nnd out into the desert until the whole world seemed made of grey and shifting sand in desol~te sweeps, high ridges and deep hollows. We've been to the Zoo, -one of the nicest ones I ever saw. We've been to the Citadel, ~nd hnve entered the "'onderful }losque of l-lohammed Ali with s,lcred yello,,' slippers :15 big as barges on our proJane tootsies. But after all it is the str~nge nnd crowded and kaleidoscopic street life which is the most enthralling part of Cniro to us so far.

Mondny, 16 December, 1912 On the Nile somewhere between Roda and Asyut, and about 180 miles from Cairo. DAHf\BYA BEDUIN EGyPT 
Darling Gopher -This is the best pa.per nnd I sh:,ll not use it often in writing to you, but am giving you a treat as long DS this is my first letter to you from the boat. I'd give anything if you were here. It is impossible to convey by written description any adequDte iden of t incomparable river "nd the scenes through ','hich it winds. And ho,,"' it v;inds! \\'e almost ïïï the compnss in our meandering. And it would t<1ke n whole day's writing, and result in a letter you would cnrry about with you -possibly -but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of scenery. The principal towns ore on the west shore, rInd it is on thnt shore thnt the railroad from Cniro to Luxor runs, and there is enough of ceDseless interest on th.. t side to hold you spellbound 110m the cool early morning through the glowing doy tothe moonlit dusk. But it's no≠thing to the' Eastern Shore with its desert stretches, its cultjY<lted str≠and terrl1ces, its pDlm groves, its native villDges so absolutely f~sci≠nating thnt eDch one fills me with delight, some of them are walled nbou and those I1h~HYS have towering palms growing \\'ithin the \\'nlls; the unw;;llled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert s'tnd out of which they rise and the desert hills i~to which they melt without one specJ~ of <.Inything green about them. And ell\l'l1Ys on th;~t m~'gic Epstern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, sometimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground. ~b≠solutely bleak and bare, of the strangest sh~pes, long stretches of them where surely no humnn foot has ever been, then long stretches where they hnve been quarried for buiJding stone, or tunnelled for tombs. Yesterd~y morning we sailed close to the foot of gigantic limestone cli1fs th~t rose precipitously out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that carne rolling llnd crvshi to the water's edge to be loaded on barges. The sunlight on this scene made a blinding glare. Ang the people -the picturesque people -no 5 stretch so barren but that you CD,n alwpys see t.hose stntely shrouded figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, f~shing, sitting motion≠less~broodi~g by the river, prnying With their fnces to the Enst, women 
fill~ng the1r wnter jars and striding up the bnnk with the full jnrs on. their he,1 d ~, d i sd a ining to touch them even with one h;! nd, people g01nf and COm1ng along the rand -on foot, on donkeys, on camels (nlw"v~ 
carne s and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the shore shepherded-!. by one or two cloaked and hooded figure~. And on the river itself grent barges loaded with cotton, with grain, with water jars p~cked so thnt they look like crenm colored cannon b~lls, _ or merely bo~ts filled witl 
pe0 pIe, but e!l c h n nd everyernftcarr ying the 1 ;1 teen s H iI, sohe ~l utif u in its s"'cep even ....∑hen its canvas is ;1 crnzy mass of tAtters. 
We are almost criminally comfortable, and systemRticnlly over-fed _ Or "'ould be if we ate fill that ....,ns set before us. The Beduin drftws anI 14 inches of water, and being towed, slides forward with such n totni absence of motion that if it were not for the scenery slipping by we w not know we were moving at nIl. There are 22 people on bonrd just to take care of us four. We tie up every night anywhere we h;.ppen to be at sunset. The tying-up process is as follows. We dnl\\' up to the bank. One of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder ~nd ..... 0 rrie sit intothe saneï Tw0 0 f the ere....∑ c Cl r ry huge wooden pins ,I sb as hitching posts, ashore and two more of the crew armed with mnllets m<Jde of sections of tree trunk hammer the pins into the s;lnd <Jnd we ~'r tied to those. Jones is always armed in case we are lying nenr n nnti Village that might be inclined to depredations. 
We hope to reach Asyut tonight where there ought to be much mail await 
ing us, and where this will be posted. We do not expect to re~ch Luxo 
till the 21st at the earliest. Goodbye for now my Darling. It's a month today since we sailed Dnd this is my 4th letter to you besides pst cards. I shall be very anxious to hear how you are after your lit operation, so don't fnil to carry out the instructions I sent you in rn last about having someone write me at once.

DCl.h;lbyrJ Beduin ≠On the Nile -tied up ne8r Nag Bamndi, Friday 20 Dec. 1912 
Darling Gopher -Doris and I went nshore at Asyut, under the escort of Bareem to take a drive through the city. The Beduin could not get close to the shore so we were landed in the feluccn with six Nubians rowing it with a man-of-war's-men precision. We lnnded at the foot 01 steep, high bank done in rough masonry, and before I had time to wondE how on earth l was to climb it I found ~yself at the topï.A trusty mariner at each elbow had wafted me thither. There's never the slight fuss, -a nod, a single word from the person in command and the thing done as if by magic. It was the same when we returned from our ~syut: spree. The Beduin and the felucca had moved up the streHm to R spot t even the felucca couldn't make n landing. ~ word from Hareem <Jnd D. r I were picked up deftly, carried through the water and set down gentl~ into the bovt. It was market day in Asyut and the entire popul tion was ~pparently in the streets. We drove through the bazanr ~nd j market where men, women, children, bulls, camels, donkeys were in one! grand mass. It is a large, important, rich town, with many elabornte; houses belonging to natives, and during our entire drive we snw~ not J single white person. 
In spite of the delights in store for us I hote to have this he~venl voyage end. To all the enchnntments of the shores have Intely been added the most wonderful flocks of birds. The Sister-Kittie :Innounce yesterda.y when we joined her on deck that a flight of at ieast a 
thousand crnnes had passed overhend, and not nIl our efforts could m, 
her come down one crnne.I myself counted sixty-two pelicans sitting on a sandbnr. And today we soiled by close to Kasz-es-Snynd ("the Hunter's Cnstle")~ nnd What easily might be n castle is nothing more hor less that u colossol pigeon-house. Hundreds of thousands of pigeong were perching on the battlements or flying about the~, nnd little flocks ~ere hastening home to them from all directions. They nre bred in this land ns much for their droppings, which make n much-prized fertilizer, as for food. (That's u horrid sounding sentence but you will understand What I menn). On the West bank of the river, opposite the Hunter's Castle, is the little town of Hou where for 53 years Shieck Selim sat stark naked on the bank of the Nile. He died a few years ago, and they built a tomb on his sitting place to Which the natives mnke pilgrimages. Clothes seem rather lightly esteemed in Egypt. If the doy is Warm the Shaduf workers wenr practically the same garb as the Ap~che Indinn, nnd their beautiful bodies look like bronze. We were p~ssing quite close to the shore when a gentleman bounded down the banks, yanked off his one and only garment and proceeded to do is laundry work in the Nile. 
Sunday -22nd December. The Beduin, Luxor. At noon yesterday ≠and a day soaked in sunshine -we came in sight of Luxor, and n short time thereafter hAd reached its outskirts, and from the window of a dnhabyo tied to the east bnnk the plensapt, tousled he~d of Nicole, nn English artist, bowed and called greetings to Cousin Theodore. Past some charming looking hotels we slipped, catching glimpses in between of the most beautiful columns of the Temple of Luxor, past the Winter Palace Hotel, and then diagonally across the rive to our mooring place on the west shore. We have it all to ourselves at present, the other boats preferring to be in the thick of every thin on the east bank. But we have n beautiful sandy beach on which the crew have pitched their tent, and where we instantly established the poultry yard. The three coops were taken from the dahabyn put on the sand nnd opened. Sir Francis Drvke ~nd his three Indies waddled mndly for the b~nk, slid down it on their tails ond launched themselves joyously upon the water. The 
White Cock stepped daintily forth, lonely but still g~llnnt. All tis \;'ives were eaten on the \yay up. But seldom are w!i.do\,'ers so soon con≠soled -by 9 a.m. teday he had three more. The turkey cock nnd his consort emerged frOID their coop so stiff they could ha:rdl.y stnnd up. But they were soon limbered, an~ the gobbler strutted ~nd rustled nnd gobbled as though he owned the earth. 
But Oh my dear! if you could see wha t 1 i e s beyond our ben ch! A gre~ t plain with stretches of sand and stretches of lovely green, and clumps of trees, and then the fierce and glaring nnd benutiful Lybian mountnins making a mighty wall beyond. I CAnnot give you any idea of how wonder≠ful it is. I could hnve spent the whole nfternoon looking, but I sudden≠ly went wild with neuralgia in my fnce ond took to my bed and suffered torments for hours, and then -as suddenly -the pain l~ft ond I slept Dll night, and got up this mbrning ready for ~nything. I Wanted to go to church this a.m. but Cousin Emma objected as my fnce Was still swollen and she snid~fhe church was always cold. 
This afternoon when Cousin Theodore had hod his nop, he, Doris, I Rnd Jones, all in Our riding clothes, w~re rowed across the river in the felucca. Our donkeys "'ere aWaiting us in front of the \\Tinter Pal.;ce, the donkey boys (old retainers) kissed Our hands and off we stnrted fo~ Karnak. We could only take a most cursory look at thos stupendous 
ruins -actu~lly inconceivable until you stnnd in their'presence.

Christmas Night Luxor, 1912 
Darling Gopher -The nicest things that hnppened to me today were receipt of your letter of Dec. 7, and the fact that Emily Morgan spent a little pnrt of the day with us. Those two things kept me from whollj 'succumbinR to homesickness. I felt its touch on my shoulder, so to spe all day long. The Serapis and Mr. Tuck and his party, of which Emily ~ Miss Kelson are two-ninths, came down from Aswan yesterday. They wave~ from the deck as they steamed by us, and soon after luncheon we went 0\ to the Serapis to call. Emily is certainly one of the sweetest things 
all the world. I was as glad to see her 115 if she were my very own. 
I hung up my stocking as I've never missed doing, but the Sister-KittiE refused to indulge in what she seemed to consider nn empty form withoui a chimney piece to hang them by. Cousin Theodore gave us his presents in Cairo -a pearl and diamond ring to Doris~ and n stunning gold mesh purse to me. Driris g~ve me ,I beautiful red linen cover with embroidery fer my table; Cousin Emma gave me an'inl:.id sand::l\"ood box, _ Dick B8ker gave me nnother one. (Doris \-iOS his agent). The Hitchell ladies, ~:rs Hoppin a.nd Aunt 1'-1nbel had all sent me pack;lges to bring ov with me. Jones gave Doris and me ea.ch a little silve~ . seal With our ;I initials in Arabic engr~ved on it. ~e were much touched by this gift.; And l-lohnmmed !∑luhnssef, the best kno\,'n and most reli,.ble antiquity de.al~ here, sent D. & me each a. scarab. Cousin T. has hnd mnnv denlins with~ so every Christmas he sends n present to each member of ~ousin T's pprl After the breakfast things were cleared from the table, the ceremony 01 giving the crew their presents took place. Cousin T. & Cousin E. sat I the table, D. & I on the divan, a.nd Jones w~s master of ceremonies. T cre\,' and,inside servvnts cnme in one by one, kissed our h:lnds, s:lid "Kulle sana \~'inta tCliyih" (A Happy Ney.. Year to you), ;lnd eclch receiv a "'h~ te sbcJ.\'J'1 a box of c i ga re t te s, f.l b;, g ~th cundy Q.nd nu t s ;1 nd some 
money, Rna de~nrted beamJ.ng. ~hen they all liad h?5 their pr~sents the 
ga thered on the de ck Cl nd shou ted "Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooray! T' ;. nk you, 
t'nnk you, t'ank you", and we retired to our several Ap:lrtments and 
wnshed our hands in dioxygen. ' 

hen the feluccn took Doris nnd me across the river, Rnd HRrry Burton 
'et usnt the steps (he i s 50ppingat the \Hntel' Pn Ince, thel'e being no 
Oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church ~hich 
s awny ut the renr of a garden filled with p;J!ms nnd :IC;ICi:l5 lind other 
ovell' things, nnd where an Arnb was ringing the bell outside, tiS they did 
n "Bunty". And Emily joined us inside. It ..... as very cpmforting to me 

o have her to go to church with us this far lund on this Dny of Dnys. 
hen we c<Jme back to the Beduin \"e brought Harry :lnd Hr. Crane (11 young 
nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crnne) to luncheon. 
fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymknna in the Winter Palpce 

;ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for ten so we couldn't. The 
'ucks came nnd Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were 
razy about the boat, nnd we hnd u lovely time. They go on their wny to 
:airo tomorrow at one. ~e had such a perfectly enormous 

inner tonight with only the four of us to ent it thnt by the time the 
:urkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, vnd h"ve it c:trried 
,ff unscathed, for we had to eot plum pudding. Jones h~ving heard me 
"emnrk that I wns going to break over my total abstinence on Christmns in 
Irder to drink a toast to you, had supplied ch"mpa~ne from the wine 
:ell~;, wherever that may be. The Cousins never touch charnpngne, so 
loris and I drnnk alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank n 
:omprehensive toast to "all the people I love". 

'e hnd a splendid ,m"il awaiting us when we got bock from church this 
Borning. It was so good to have it come on Christmns Dny. I do hope 
TOU got my first letter very soon after you sent yours. I think I ex≠)1 v inedinitth;1t pe 0pIe told uson no acc 0unt top0stIettel's n t Gibï 
Jecnuse it sometimes took months for them to re~ch their destinntions froJ 
there. So I only mailed you a postenI'd from there & sent my first letter 
~rom Naples the minute we landed on the 27th. 

Jec. 26th. Doris and I mounted on our gnllont donkeys, (mine is n:Jmed 3ugn r) and followed by our donkey boy s (mine is no med }jahmoud) rod e off this morning towards the Liby~n mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi -see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot. fhe figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, mnking the entire height 65 ft. ~ven in this land of mighty marvels they seem all that there is of the ~(traordinnry. Well, deorest, dozens of other letters must be Nritten, sofureth'ee well for now. 
Endless love ~nd many blessings on your belove head. Your very o'l'"n !-'iim

The principal thing that hns occurred since my lnst \\'eek's letter to 	1I

alone so I went with her. Our vehicle was a sort of surrey thing dr~ 
\l! eJ
by two mules and driven by n pirate in baggy white "trou." When w~ " ful
finally entered the Volley my breath wns taken awny. It was like dri~

less stretches of broken fragments of flint and limestone and fossili~ shells, the blf1zing sun, the splendid cloudless sky. The house is ih~ ...∑hat is called the West Valley, which, thouRh it contnins two or threes tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs, being divided from that by a ridge. The ho~ is long, 10'" (one storied) fl<lt-roofed, made of rOUg stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican hous~ It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cLiffs directly behind f Dal and n stone's throw across the road in front of it ~nother ridge divid yOl ing it from a third valley. The bedrooms <Ire like cells with little 5 As of windows in the foot-nnd-a-half thick walls. The. sitting room is bJ po

WSaturdwy morning we <111 proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin 1: mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves! de his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair cnrri. CiT bvtwomenBndD. & I on foot. It wns a sensation of ~ lifetime to I Tl visit that place for the fi~st time. A number of tombs are open to t~ s: public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his dei tl 3ut Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the vnlleYi . s'it ...∑as amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gClping tourists <.nd dis:1pp ". into an opening labelled "Ro Admi ttance" from ""hich ....∑ere issuing clouq ..: of dust and n procession of children cr1rrying dirt elnd rocks in brIsket b which they empti~d on a dump.

to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off by myself. Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our too ties explor 
the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why elll the kings didn' make their tombs there I cannot understand. It is the most regal,

West Bank at Luxor -10 Janunry 1913 
Darling Gopher -It's more than h,'o "-eeks since I've heard from 
you nnd I'm beginning to be afraid thut u letter must h~ve been lost, 
1\s for me I've \\'ritten you \-,ith the utmost regulnrity, beginning with ;, 
postal from Gib, follo~ed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in 
Naples on the 27th, pursued by another muiled at Alexandria Dec. 2, 
since ~hich I've ~ritten once a week. 1\ letter just brrived from Jack 
Stewart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has written 
you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter". Of course I am wholly 
mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remote≠
ness will begin to be intolerable. 
Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency ond th~ days flit by on the wings of the wind. I bask in constant sunlight, and wenr summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin Theodore persistently refers to me, ....∑hen speaking to Doris, as "Your sister". Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry Burton this morning before breakfust saying thnt he hnd found (in n new sepulchrill chamber he opened n fe'" dflys ngo) Cl red granite s;)rcoph~gus with n recumbent f~Gure carved on the lid. The note further said it would take about t~o dnys to clear "W~y the debris in which it is em≠bedrle~. Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and ~wnit developments. I want to go also, but it isn't fClir to lenve Cousin Ernmn alone so I'm going to stay with her. I think I shall ride p8rt ~?y with them for the s8ke of the ride, and then come b8ck <Jlone \\'ith l-lahmoud J my donkey boy -and possibly one of the crew. When Cousin T., D. & I go out we ~r' quit~ a cavalcade -we three mounted, and three donkey boys and two sailors running beside us. I've come to the reluctant conclusion that my donkey, Sugar J has too sm,!ll a tummy to cinch <J sidest:lddle to. J.ly saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount Bnd hold up the procession and hnve it readjusted. Jones thought it might be the fnult of the soddle, and, in his determination to have me suited J the other day he, assited by biO donkey boys R.nd six of the ere"', s"ddled "nd unsHddled that one sma.ll donkey ,,'ith various sidesaddles "'hile ;.11 Luxor looked on. But no sidesaddle st~ys put for more thnn fifteen minutes on Sugar, so I think I'll have to give him up. I hate to,-he's so pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim. 
Sunday aft~rnoon we took a rHther unusunl ride, not visiting nny ruins 
(which is what we ...1rnast <ll\>'nys do) but riding through miles of cuIti≠vuted ~ields where steam ployghs were at work and the w<lter flowing 
through cemented irrig<lting ditches,-all more modern "nd progressive 
than anything we hnve seen, and quite dull and uninteresting comp<Jred 
with the native methods.

Dori s met some a,,'fully amusing young Englishmen, t,,'o or three of "'hom could actuDlly dance ,,'ell, and I enjoyed myself immensely just tnlkin to people. 
,,'e've just had a Baron rind Baroness Von Bissing lunching with us. He 
is a sort of German translation of Leonard &~con. The resemblnnce is 
too amusing. 'I'e see by the Paris Herald that George Bourne has been 
married. I ..... onder if he will co~e out here on his wedding journey. 

You will now be able to tell me something of Mrs. Noses. I've writte tWice without getting an answer to either missive. I cnnnot underst~ it. Please be sure to send me her new address, though I should thinl Savannah, Georgia would reach her. And have you been to see Kim? Please go! I can't bear to have him forget his family. Dr. Nolte i, the nclme-;-vnd you can find the 'addre ss in the telephone book. 
Endless love from us both and please write to your adoring

I hope you wrote to your grandmother at Christmas time. If you hovel 
done so, do it noW for my sake. She wrote me she sent you a couple 

books.

Darling Gopher -Your letter of the 8th arrived tod~y, -fift days is pretty quick work, the quickest possible I fancy. I w~s ~wf glad to get it, and I am also glad to be able to tell you that i~s qUite all right with Mr. Eells as well as with Mrs., for I had n fir 
~~ng lelLer from him on Sunday expressing much disnppointment, but r traces of annoynnce aty~urfDilure to come to Cleveland. He is so sensitive I WHS afraid he might think you ~ent to Snvnnnnhmerely bE CRuse you preferred to. Congratulc1tions on having p~ssed your ex~m~ also on hnving done the nice thing at Christmas by Nnn, and others j your grandmother. By the way, did you really -CIS metn to mnn, mind. like your waistcoat? Doris and I had an argument over it. She mnil you would think it vulgarly loud, while I insisted that there w~s n( in getting a fnncy waistcoat unless it ..... as fancy, and I thought it , go very well with the Oxford grey clothes I made you get. Bud Tnlb' had alrendy, in n letter to we, broken the horrid news about Lefty Cloister has certainly got D black eye this Winter, nicht wnhr? 
V<>rious exciting things have happened " a ll in the blue, unclouded W since my last letter. On Sunday Doris and Cousin T., mounted on th donkeys and accompanied by the peerless Jones, bnsely deserted Cous 
,I 
-Emma and me Bnd trotted over to the Vnlley to spend the night' while we∑ had to sit tamely on deck like perCect ladies, and dispense ten "nd ;. cukes to str;lnge /\meric,lns Crom BuCf;.lo ....'hom we had never seen before. Sir Gaston Haspero W8S to join them the next morning at the Tombs ~nd pronounce judgement on the red granite snrcophagus. The next afternoon I hnd just got bnck from a long walk (nccompanied by n sailor with ~ heavy stick,) packed With Clens which I had nnnexed in a native village I sUddenly found myself in; and Was having ten on deck in company with thl Can te s sa Con t<J rdone (I nd Nr. Tremaine when the CH V;, I cn de re turned from the Valley. It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning from the Africnn desert as they Cnme in single file ocross the sAnds; fir the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris & Jones with the donkey boys running beside the~, and Julius C~esnr brny≠ing his head off as they cnme. Doris Was benming. She had hnd the most wonderful time with Maspero who had lunched with them in the House in the Valley and who talked (IS she never had heard nnyon~ t(llk before. He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in Cairo, but also Wclnts Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of 250 poinds sterling for its transportation there: 
The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next dc1y n t the 
great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of n noted 
Arab snoke-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the 
purpose. \vewent, and it ,~as an extraordinary experience. (Doris h"d 
a nasty spill on the w(ly out. Her donkey itepped into n pitfnll~ flung 
her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, with 
her usual plucX, and in the end suffered no serious eCfects). I simply 
h'lven't time to give you an account of '''hat happened at the ruins. It 
was both drnmntic nnd astounding. The Arab stalking in front of the 
picnic l who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incnntntion in 
a loud clear voice, nn~ lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the 
desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple w~ll. 

Yesterday I pl~yed in a tennis tournament at the Winter P~luce ond 
carried off a cup (the 1st Prize),-not by my own prowess but by that 
of my pnrtner, Cl very nice Scotchman nn.med HllcNaughton who plClyed ;l 
corking gnme. 

_Jhis afternoon D. & I went over there ngnin on invitnti0n to ,,,;,tch ;1 ra ther mild but quite flmUS ing gymkha na, ,'nd en joyed ourselve s immensely. And now I must turn in Hnd get some of that sleep thnt I seem to requir-e more here thun anywhere else in the world. I suppose now you cannot get that operation done till the Spring vacCltion. I wonder if postponing it ~as wise.

Darling Gopher -We are now wondering whether Edith w~s ~llowed 
to return to Ne\\' He'1.ven for the Prom p-roper. In a letter Doris h;,d from 
Dick he said he hnd met you on the street and you hnd told him of your 

hopes and fears (though he didn't put it that wny.) . I have 11 feeling 
that she did come bnck. I fnncy Mrs. Finch likes now and then to mnke 
a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense. I sh~ll nwait 
your description of the Prom with interest -~ and such patience ~s I 
cnn summon to my aid. It's two weeks since I've hod n letter from you. 
r W(lS rejoiced yesterday by .one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which 

combined the advuntnges of A long-desired missive from ~ friend ~nd ~ ~I puzz.le. She writes one of the most in~ecipher;'ble'h;'nds I've ever :1 ( encountered.

Nothing particulnrly thrilling has happened since my last letter. Thet chi ef destin/I tion 0f 0ur rides for the p Clst \,'eek has been our new digg:: at Nedinet Hobu which is much nearer than the old diggings nt the Tombi of the [(ings. Doris <Jnd I rode over there yesterduy ;,fterooon to chee; Harry up a bit. He occasionally gets tired of not seeing Cl v,'hite pers'( to speak to for days at a time. I sat on a block of stone thvt h"d one been part of a temple pillar, and Doris wandered about picking up chun} of carnelian, and my donkey boy took his clothes off -just ','hy I c;,nn( say. F ortunu tely he pu t them on agr' in. On leaving Harry to hi s d ig/?iJ' we rode up into a hollow in the Libyon Hills to see a temple we hnd ~oi yet visited -a gem of a temple, called Der-el-Medineh. The view nloni off towards the Nile through n wide cleft in the rocks Wns worth gOing' far to see. And the superb looking J\.r;Jb, gunrdi8n of the pl"ce, w;,s S( moved by my present of seven cents thClt he knocked }lahmoud, my donkey 1 out of the wny and held my donkey himself while I mounted. On our homi ward way Doris left me on a maJ g~llop to catch up to a bRby c;,mel she saK in the distnnce. The maternal c;,mel v,'as not ple;,sed by this ;,tten. tion and tried to take (I bite out of Doris, but, happily, failed. 
I've been twice out to luncheon this week -once with the F~hnestocks on their Dahobya "Cheops", and once nt the Winter Palace with the Pier~ The Piers are ench;lnting people and so nice to us. They had Doris ove'f for dinn::r nnd the d~nce aguin Tuesday night. It is 6uch ;, ple;tsure b her and I'm so thnnkful she c<Jn h;,ve it. The incessC'.nt c<'rdpl"ying is r"ther hard on her. I tru to help out by playing dominoes as much ns : can; but Cousin T. so much prefers bridge. 
Give my specinl love to Jack and tell him I live in hopes of finding t: to answer his letter as it deserves. My love to Wilson foss. And, dearest, to please me, bo and callan Mrs. Bnker. It isn't decent not to ,,'hen sh_ehas been so kind <lbout <tsking you there. 
I made a mistake in saying it hnd been h,'o '... eeks since I h;,d <I letter i from you. It's only a little over one. God bless my boy. I hn,e ti~ of being very homesick for you. .

It v,'HS quite notie of you to '''rite to m so soon and shen you were still so nevrly dend with fntigue. I enclo the order on the bank which you asked for, nnd I put in the P.S. just just to remind you not to absent-mindedly cnrry off the key. 

On \Yednc sday Do ris I. nd I hfJ done o:r the pI e~' sant cho cks of our live s "-'hen tI bOllt dre\~ up beside the Beduin nnd deposited Hr. Dodge "nd Jnnet. None of our Clcvel.. nd letters hnd mentioned th,∑t they \\'ere coming pbro,∑d so it wns Dn absolute surprise. They had corne up the river on the R~meses III, nnd left for Aswnn the next dny, but they nre to be here for D week on their return. I went over to the Rnmeses to callan Mrs. Dodge. I think she was quite cross because neither Pnige nor HO"'urd Eells hnd wri tten me they "'ere corning. 
Tuesday Doris pnd I hod n lovely time. Harry hod invited us to come ovet to the vnlley so as to show us the tomb of Horemheh and me the sarcophngus in Siphtuh, and then to have luncheon With him at the House. We had breakfast an hour eurlier than usunl, lind then started ofr on our donkeys with our aonkey boys and a sailor as escort, and Jones to rollow us soon as he hud got Cousin Theodore started for the dny. We rode along the river's edge as far 8S the ferry landing place directly opposit! Luxor, before turning toward the R;)nge. The ferry landing th"t morning "'us "'orth going miles to see. Two ste<lmers had come up the night berore and scores upon scores of people ,'nd donkeys ;:lnd s<tndc~'rts ~,nd c;lrri?ges hnd corne "cross to take some of the numerous expeditions on this side. The gay trappings or the donkeys, the blue and white clothes or the donkey boys with a dash of red on their chests nIl made fine coloring; seven native policemen in Khaki, with their carnes waiting for them in the background, the bustle and conrusion nnd everybody yelling nt once -it \,'as all immensely enterttlining to me. It was a perfectly delicious dny, like nIl our dnys, und I did enjoy the ride. The light nrid color on the Libyan Rnnge as ~e netlred it were more ffir>rvellous thnn nnything I've ever seen, -surpassingly beautiful, but so blinding we hRd to pull down our chifon veils. The tombs ~ere intensely interesting, especinlly tho: p;,intings on the ,,'aIls of Horemheh. The unfinished p,lrt interested me even more thnn the beauty of the completed work;-it was just ps thoug the urtist -dead thous<!nds or ye,lrs ago -h~ld lr~id do\om his pencil :.nd brushes to go home to luncheon. Our luncheon D.t the House ,,'ith H~.rry and Hr. Cliane v,'as a very j.olly ;lfrai-r;-~!nd ~lt three \,e st<Jrted for home, getting back at teatime and finding the dnhnbyn seething with people. 
One other day this week I was invited by the Contessn Contnrdone to go 
t.o }5;arnak."'ith <J s!U"ll ∑pDrty, of ,,'hom the Russian Princess Gortschokoff was one. Karnak is alwtlys one of the most,~onderful-plndes in the world, but that afternoon it was secondary in my eyes to the Princess with whom I fell madly in love. Think or a Princess -a renl one -like those i~ novels and storybooks; young, lithe, beautiful, f~scinRting, quiet and absolutely simple in her m'lnner. I couldn't keep my eyes off her. J\'e watched the workman excavatin a large and bec1utiful jar clnd hoped it would be packed with jewels, but when it Was emptied nothing but <J brick materi~llized. \,'e paid D. visit to the uncanny goddess Sekmet, she with the lion's head. It is a lire-sized statue of black grnnite which stands in a dusky room in the temple of Ptah, lighted only b~ a small squRre Window high up in the roof.

Endless love, dearest, from Your l'lim. 
I long to see you. I don't know how I can WRit till June. Are you c~ming to any definite decision as to whether you will go to Utoh or not next summer? I had a letter from Mr. Wnlcott that shocked me grently.

To make matters worse the sun -the brilliant,_ constant, revivifying Egyptian sun -hDs withdrawn its light for two whole days, and it actually rained all dvy yesterday, resulting in tl damp ~lnd cold ~!nd gloom on "'hich rheumatism thrives.

Rest Beloved -Your letter of the 9th has just come and it m~de me weep -I feal so awfully about Crosson Hayes. ~hat a perfe~~ly dreRd≠ful thing to hDve hap~eri.

And now I want to exp1nin why I've ~ritten so m~ch more elaborate letters to Adeline than to you. I kne\\' she \,'as going to miss me more even th;,n you, because she lives such R shut-in life with so few distr"ctions nnd almost no occupations; and so I hvve written those letters to her as full and "S well us my very limited leisure permitted. Then, too, I truly would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fe~r you wouldn't rend them. Very few young men have the pntience to repd long letters. Edward Firth told me that he sometimes cnrried n letter from his mother for a week in his pocket without. reading it. Of course I len0 ,",' you w'ouldn't do th"t, for our rel;ltions \vith e,'en other ,'re quite

Oh Gopher, I don't know whnt I would not have given to hnve hnd you here today to go with us on our expedition to the Great Dam. It surely must be one of the Woriders of th~ World -and whot a fent of engineering: We left Luxor Saturday the 1st and got here yesterdny the 4th -133 miles B~edeker snys. Awfully 510\-,' going, -but then \,'e stopped t\-;ice, the first time at Edfu ~hat Doris and I might see the temple there; .nnd the second time at Kom Ombb for us to inspect thnt temple, nnd also becnuse the wind h',IS blov.. ing so terrificCllly that n"vig"tion W,iS excessively unple"spnt, so \\'e tied up there at "bout one on 1∑10nday and didn't strlrt ;'g:∑in until e;,rly the next (resterdny) morning. Although ,,'e \,'ere ,,'ithin two minutes \~(1lk oL the temple D. <lnd I did not stir off thE) bo"t until five o'clock idlen the "'ina died do..... n. That Kom Crn∑∑bo temple is an extr~ordin;\ry one because it is duplex -one side being dedicnted to n good god -the elder Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk. I prefer the later n,'me bec,luse it sounds like a crocodile, if stlid down in your throat with full value given to nIl the consonnnts. There is one room in a little ch~pel on Sobk's side which is full ofmummied crocodiles -quite the. horrides∑t∑ things I've seen in a-long ~while. ∑-The temple-∑is in ~ most .... ruinous condition, but, ~erhaps, all the more beoutiful for that, ond the s:.tuntion <tnd views fIre superb. D. and I climbed uP. on the ''''reck 6f ,I splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset "nd indulging in a plensHnt melClncholy, and h'id it all to ourselves, ,except for the fc!ith≠ful escort, Hnneen and a sailor, Who dogged our feetsteps. It re"lly is awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here -for they are tired to denth of it, hnving seen it so many times, and they don't go anywhere or do Llnything except stny on the boat und nrr,!nge for us to see the sights. Yesterday morning shortly nfter we left Kom Ombo we found u mile of flamingoes sblnding in ranks and files on the sandbclr5: 
\'ie 'Irr∑i..."ed here about 12:30 yesterday and it \\'(15;) joyful cre\,' th"t tied us up, for most of them live here. Doris and I did the bnz~nr yesterdny afternoon with H,'neen to drive bargains for us ;lnd Amelie ;.nd ;, s,∑ilor in our tr~in. You understand that "the b<Jz,'t1r" in these towns menns f1 long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs ne~rly meeting overbend and tiny shnllow little shops like pigeonholes nIl olong on both sides. We thought the bazaar in Coiro enthralling, but itf~lls short of this 
one though it's much l"rger. This one so reeks of the desert and the 
strange things∑thnt come out of it. You would hnve gone wild over the 

leopard skins and the Soudtlllcsc wec'pons, .,nd the scores 01 thinr.s 
never seen anywhere else.

Sunday afte~noon, and on Monday she and Cousin Theodore took their last ride on Julius Caesar and Hermes, -while I hod to do the society act for the family, going out to suy goodbye to the teachers at the American mission school, and then taking a farewell tea with the Corlessa. That last was quite unnecessary because she left Luxor just as '~e did, yesterday and ''''e are all to meet in Cniro. But the poor lady had been ill in bed and was lonely -and I always like to see her. Tuesday Doris and Cousin Emma went over to Luxor early in the morning and I played dominoes. Harry came over from the Valley and spent most of the day. The diggings have stopped (this is the seuson for stopping them) and Harry \vill join us in Cairo, going down by train in about ten days when he has done the final settling up of ever~thing in the Valley. Nr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our discoveries are the only important ones made this winter at Thebes. 
LaDcelot Crane came to tea that afternoon and he and Harry and D and 1 can ~lways amuse ourselves vaitly talking to each other. Some ladies Cou sin Emma kne".' al so came. And pre sen tl y Grane and Harry mounted their donkeys and with a wave of their hats turned towards the valley. 
lIe left Luxor shortly after eleven, I think, yesterday morning and it ~as gectic getting off. The sands were dotted with natives who had come to say goodbye, and get a parting bnckshish, and on the Luxor side, as we pnssed, tradesmen whom we had patronized, and many friends of the crew waved frantically at us. We have come skiMoing down thus far -and oh these lovely banks! They are covered with poppies now in long stretches. We got to Dendereh yenterday afternoon about five and stopped for Doris and me to see thAt temple. Jones said it \"as a very Iittle '.;alk. "A Iittle wCI.lktt in this family means not more than n ten-minute one, so we started on foot. But it had been some years since Jones had done it and he had forgotten. It WDS almost, if not quite, two miles there, which wouldn't have mattered in the least if it hudn't been so late. T'\\'o sailors 'vere sent With us, and we walked us fast as we could, but we only got there in time to see the sunset from the roof-Which alone was worth the expedition, and then fairly tore through the dim recesses of the temple and down into the mbst_umazing crypt. It was so spooky there that it Was com≠forting to think that the Gaffir -having seen our <1thletic gu,.rdi'lns at the gates o~ the temple -would not dare to murder us as he so easily might. It w.ts a 1,'onderful walk back -qui te recompensing us for the calling do','n that a"'v.ited us. The relatives h;ld grown frightened about our being out 8~ter dark, and ~ere cross in conse≠quence. Of course it was Jones who out to have been called dow -but considering all Jones does for us I'd always rather take ~ scolding than have him get one. We started out with an escort of two s~ilors, ~nd we. CRme back with four sailors (two more having been sent out to meet us) b,o n,ltive men ";ho hud attached tbemselves to the p,'rty, 
h:o children nnd b>o go∑uts.

Cairo -Saturday -22 Nch 1913 
Best Beloved -Here \,'e tIre vgl\in, helving finished the voyage down the river Thu~sday morning. Said voyage ~as more or Ie spoiled by the incessant winds which made sitting on deck disagree~ and uncomfortable; and sitt~ng on deck is the main point to :~ trip on the Nile. Our running onto the numerous sandbars which now impe navigation in the present low state of the river Doris and I regard as interesting. It was so amusing watching the men get us off. Wednesday morning we sat on a sandbar for an hour in company with 2 large steamers, i small steamer and 27 netive boats! 
~e are to stay on the boat until a week from today when we move to 
Ghezireh Palace. This may sound as though we were to visit the l\.nedive, but it's merely an hotel \~here a hnedivi,l.l pC!.lace used to and which is run by the same management as Shepheurd's. Being on a 
island in the river it is pleasanter at this time of year than Sher 
heard's III 
Yesterday, being Good Friday, I went to church. Doris d{ddt feel well so I went alone in the huge red motor car. The cburch WaS ful and many, many men "'ere there. That's one .. of the fire things about Englishmen -they stand steadfastly by the training of their youth~ in the matter of churchgoing. Coming out I stopped for a moment tc look at the plain little tablet set in the hall at the end of the church in memory of that great hero Gordon. Outside the door I found l'li's. Romeyn and Emma \∑.'ai ting for me. 
Your letter of the 6th has just come and I'm cuttin~ this short in∑ order to catch tonight's mail and let you know at once our plans n as I know them. I can't understand how I've failed to do it befor We sail from Alexandria April 9th, arrive in Florence probnbly tbe

Cairo 
Best Beloved -As Doris wrote you early in the ~eek I post≠poned my writing. We moved to this hotel Friday and were glad to get a~ay from the dD.ha bya on ac count of the hea t ','hi ch wa s grov.:ing too great on the river. It's much cooler here. The rooms are perfectly gigantic -truly palatial. There's a nice garden to walk or sit in. 
But I have a confused feeling, -my room is so big I can't find any of' 
my things without hunting allover the place. I feel that we are "asting opportunities here but we can't help ourselves. I've done only 
two things worth doing since last Sunday. One of them Was the Torch≠
light Tattob Tuesday evening on Kasr ~i Nil Barrncks Ground. It Was a 
very fine spectacle, -quite thrilling:to see issuing forth from a∑ grea t door\\'a.y t\\'o hundred Gordon Highlanders each carrying f.l torch. They marched and evoluted in lines of iight; and finally took their 
stand outlining three sides of a tremendous hollo~ square in ~hich nIl 
the performances took place. 
The ether worth-while incident of the week was spending a couple of hours in the museum \{ednesday morning and seeing the wonders there in the new light of my recently acquired learning in Egyptology. For the rest I've gone to dressmakers and done errands, and taken little drives to nowhere and played many games of dominoes. This morning Harry Burton and I w~nt.to church while Doris staid on duty, and this after≠noon I staid while Doris and Harry went to the Zoo. They had a fascina≠ting time and saw ,many en~hanting sights -baby lions and baby giraffes and .a.~ip'po. th<J,.-t c;;amE' when itwas called and op-=:ned and shut, -att-he bidding of its keeper. the cavern it calls its mouth; and a baby ele≠pha.~t marching at the heud of a company of Scotch pipers; and they hRd their tea ona tiny island in a little lake Where they were surrounded by pelicnns and flamingoes. 
Tomorrow we go to Sakkara. on camels -a 16 mile ride in all. I'm doing 
it out of pure bravado because Doris thinks I can't. "Mother you're 
crazy: And Roger wouldn't allow it for a minute if he were here." But 
you are no there, are you darling? Ala s: tha t you a re no t: And I kno\\' 
you like your mother to be a true sport. Harry and Doris and I and a 
Lady Hilda something to whom we have talked several times, and who is 
who is cutting a~l kinds of engagements tomorrow to go with us. 
Goodnight my own dear boy. God bless you and keep you safe.

Best Beloved -Jones has just informed me that unless I get my letters off at 2:30 this afternoon they won't go for three days. It is now 12:30 and luncheon in half an hour. So this must be dashed off at a gallop. Oh my dear! that camel expedition on Monday was the most wonderful thing I ev~r did. Of course I was horribly lame for 2 days afterwards, but so were Harry an~ Doris. Yc would have adored it, -I'd have given anything to have had you alon/ They weren't awfully good camels either~ so I can imagine the rapture of riding fine ones. Harry went off the other day on an expedition with some English people one of whom was the Major of a Highland regiment. Said Major furnished the camels from the coestguard corps and H'arry ,said they "'ere perfectly 'superb, and much much easier to r: than the ones we had. . . 
We've haunted bazaars and done errands and had some swagger clothes made (for which your uncle insisted on paying; -but we wouldn't havi had them otherWise), and had visitors and ~one to teas, and revelled 
in street sights, and I've seen the hnedive and almost seen Lord Kitchener but not quite, and have met one of the highest-up men in tJ Army here -Major ~atson, or Watson Pasha -whichever you choose to 
call him, who is aide-de-camp to the Ehedive. He is an enchanting person and if he weren't already married I should try to get him for Little Sister. 
We are sailing Wednesday so my next letter will be from Naples where we expect to spend two days, going thence to Florence. No letter 
from you since 2 '" eeks ago. Hor;~' all goes wel.1 ,,'ith you. Endless 
love from ..., Your }.jim 
The Mediterranean -10 April, 11] Dampfer "Prinz Heinrich" 
Best Beloved. We left Cairo yesterday morning at 9:45 and re~che~ Alexandria at one after a comfortable trip through such lovely scene~ I couldn't bear to take my eyes off the windows for a minute. We I sailed at 2:30 and are due in Naples at 11 A.M. Saturday. If we Dret not late and if the day is pleasant (it's funny I remembered to say t that after four months of pleasant dnys as a matter of course) Herrt is going to take Doris -and me if I can get off ~ to Pompeii. And' Sunday Cousin T. is planning to take us on a marvellous motor trip D~ 

the coast of Amalfi. Monday we shall probably proceed upon our way to Florence. Before leaving Cairo we managed to work in a little luOre s~gnLseeing. We saw a mosque -the second largest in the world, and quite beautiful. It contains two objects of particul~r interest ≠a granite column that came there all by itself from }lecca, and a mdgic stone which When people have violent tummy aches they go and lick until their tongues bleed. Quite a deep hollow had been licked in it, and the blood stnins on the base were very revolting. We also went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which form a sort of Stately City of the Dead with superb domes and exquisite minare~s, on the outskirts of the City proper and close to the desert. Doris and I would have given our eyeteeth for one untrammeled "'eek in Cairo. There ~Ire such wonderful things to see and do there nnd we missed so mnny of them through no fault of ours. 
I do so hope to find a letter from you in Naples forwarded from Poris. 
It seems very long since I heard. 
Your loving, loving Mim. 

Grande Bretagne Florence 18 April, 1913 
Best Beloved -We are feeling so terribly over the news 
of Charlie Walcott's death which we just heard yesterday. I have 
tha t most despera te of all feelings -the belief tha t someho\<' it m;ght 
have been prevented. This is no reflection on his father, who could 
not drop everything and go with him to California. But if he had hnd 
a mother or his sister to go with him we would not have been subjected 
for so long to what Mr. Walcott himself ~rote me Was "the wrong 
treatment." The one ray of comfort in the whole tragedy is thnt he is 
now with his mother. 

I got your letter of Zarch 20th the other day in Naples, just after I had posted mine to you. And your April 1st one re~ched me here yester≠day. We had to waste one d27 in Naples as it rained so torrentiDl1y~ :J.nc! practically the sale frUit of our stay there ,,"as that Doris sa;\' Pompeii -"'hich "'as one of her heart's desires. 1 ":ould have liked to see it too, for in the 30 years which have elapsed since I wvs there much has been excavated. But it wasn't possible for us both to do it, and I Was cruzy to have D. go. We got here Tuesday night, h~ving left Naples at 9:45 that morning, with Vesuvius covered a third of 
"the wny down from its summit with snow. The cold and the rain here in Italy have been hard to bear after the sunlight and warmth of Egypt. But it is such an entrancing trip here from Naples -such verd~nt count such beautiful vinyards, such a riot of flo'\'ers, the mount<J.ins and hills so splended and so romantic with the feudal towns cro~ning the summits of the foothills and long, long roads leading up to them. On the enclosed ca~d I've marke~ about where our sitting room windo~s 
are, and the br1dge you see 1S the far famed Ponte Vecchio, lined on both sides with the most enthralling shops. Kear the bridge this side of the Ponte Vecchio, and Which just misses getting into the picture, someone wns committing suicide as we drove up to the hotel the night of our arrival.

Dctrling Gopher This letter is some",hClt belated and I'rlJ. sorry.':! We left Florence Monday afternoon, April 28th at five in the Clftern¢ I and reached here Tuesday night at quarter of eleven; and dearly as ~ Er love England I am now getting so imp"tient to be home that I have a~ co constant pushing feeling inside of myself. On the SundCly before le;i sn ing Flo rence I ,,' ent to the Ameri can Church and encoun te red the Iiomej( He and we wal~ed home together. D. and I also ran across them the.nex I Ie 
morning when "'e were paying a final visit to the beauties contu1~e~ tÄ in the church of Santa Croce. Mrs. Romeyn Was full of Rad's nob~l~ in sticking to his job instead of accepting her invitation for h1m come to Europe for the summer. 

I∑ 
! 
]∑lr. R. observed that nadcliffe ,,'us not fond of Europe: "But he is fond of his family" I said. "Oh: he likes his mother" said 1'1r. 
R. -"but not me:" I never have been able to make }∑jr. R. out: 
\'le saw Helen Wolcott again, -she came to see us; nnd I hnd from 1-1r. 
Walcott one of the most desperately p9thetic letters I ever rend. 
The sense of Charlie's loss grows continually greater with me, und the 
rose color has faded out of everything. One of the very first thinÄs 
I meant to do on getting home Was to go to see him, and it makes my 
heart heavy to think that the utmost I can ever do now is to go ond 
put some flowers on his grave. 

As in Italy so also here -we motor and motor and motor. It's for≠tunate that both D. and I are so fond of it. Here we hnve one of the finest cars I've ever ridden in; -but it's always a limosine which destroys ::;()Ioe of the pleasure. Today we've been to St. Albans -8 magnificent cathedral, the largest, I'm told, in England, and built on the site where the first martyrdom to Christianity took place in England. As eousinT. ~8S WRiting for us outside we didn't h~lf see it, but the drive there and back was lovely. 
I got your letter, telling of your visit to Kim and that you thought of goine to Sonopah with Fred Brown, ju~t before leaving Floren~e. Would that I, too, might go to Sonopah. 
The:-Bakers seem to have been very kind about inviting you to meals. I hope you have called spontaneously at least once. If not plense do it before we get home. I don't want my rapture at being with you once again marred by finding you've been rude to people who h~ve been kind to you. Also it will be more in keeping With your self respect 
to go by yourself than to be dragged there by the seat of your trou by an irnte ~im. Oh Deerest how good it will be to see you again: 
God keep you safe. Your loving l"lim.

Best Beloved -Since ~y last letter I'v~-been 'so unhappy I 
just couldn't bring ~yself to write. It is nothing that ha~ h~ppenud 
to any of this party, and it's nothing that I feel like writing about; 
though I'll tell you the whole story when I get home. 0 blessed word ≠Home:. But the thing has been so constantly in my mind that I've not ~een 8ble to enjoy anything. 
I dined with Mrs. Bonbright the other evening nt CIRridges. She and Mr. B. live over here most of the time now, and have n place in the country. They were staying in town for n few dnys preparatory to sailing for America ("'hich they did on Saturday) for HOvJard' s ,∑,>edding: He is marrying a Detroit girl named Elizabeth Hodges, Hnd if she is vS lovely us her picture she must be a Queen indeed. We are invited to tea on ~ednesday to meet Norman Sturgis and his wife! -or ruther 
they are nsked to meet us. The Luckrafts nre in town and being aWfully nice to us, and so is Lily Solly. Mrs. Bell is still in America. We've done a lot of motoring through this lovely English country. It's a heavenly time of year to be here, but the weather has been horrid. We motored to Oxford yesterday and on our Way bnc) stopped at Stoke Poges, where Wm. Penn was born, and saW the exquis' Hnd very cheerful churchynrd \-:here Grey '''rote his Elegy. \l'e also . came through Eton and saw scores of Eton boys in their silk hats. Their ends didn't correspond -for almost all of them wore slovenly ~npolished shoes. 
D. and I have been to three picture g<!lleries and h<lve seen such hauntingly lovely things that if it ":eren't for my durling son and hankering to see him, I'd like to Sbl}' here another month just to look at pictures. I must have told you -though I can't remember _ that D and I are going to the York-ihn.ll, as I suppose the lviclcSherry are still at 615, and I hope they'll st8Y there all summer. 
I'll probably write you one more little note before we sail. Don't forget date and ste:lmer -l-ltly 21, Kronprinz \Vilhelm. 'I!e ought to 1 on the 28th. Of course I don't kno'" ",'he the r or no t yo u ,.,' ere pI., nni 
to meet us, or \,'ould be uble to. Sut I'm going to say "Don't". Every extra person onlycadds to poor Cousin T's confusion of mind, we'll.take the first trnin we can for New Hoven. I'll telegrDph yo 
the minute we land. 
I've had so much to trouble me recently, nnd I feel so piffliss, I don't want any flaw in my homecoming. So if you love your Mim you' be sure to ha1,'e done the things I've made <". point of your doing (c:; ing on the D--:.tlcers, and .,'riting those letters) b~fore I get there. 
Goodnight ow..! a million blessings on your dec.:.r he"d, l"y love to JU~k and to Wilson. Your loving Nother.

Best Beloved  - It was  a  joyful surprise  to  get  your  letter  
from  Kansas  City,  and  I  hope  mine  to  you  from  Newport  reached  you  

before you left Denver for Leadville. I got back from Newport 
last Tuesday and on Friday went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to 
spend the night with the Taylors. I had positively promised them a 
visit so I had to go. Henry Devereux was,there and we had a nice 
ol~ fashioned Colorado time, and the next day they motored me all the way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the L~wn Club before 
they returned to The Hill. 
Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she Kould wire me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has come, and I'm so an~:ious I've telegr;)phed llrs.

I ~,,'ent out to see I:im this afternoon ;lnQ he, too, \\'as a vision o:f bec:.uty in my eyes. He h;!d just been bnthed and he Was a reddish fluff. He almost ate me up, talking hyste~ic~IIy until he \-;c:.s exhous ted and :fIopped fIn t on hi s Iit tIe tu=y on the floor, thumping his tail and rolling the ','hites of his eyes at me.

Your letter telling o~ ,~11 your Colcrf~do Springs doings and the psa

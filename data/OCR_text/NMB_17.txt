 
Oh Gopher, I don't know whnt I would not have given to hnve hnd you here today to go with us on our expedition to the Great Dam. It surely must be one of the Woriders of th~ World -and whot a fent of engineering: We left Luxor Saturday the 1st and got here yesterdny the 4th -133 miles B~edeker snys. Awfully 510\-,' going, -but then \,'e stopped t\-;ice, the first time at Edfu ~hat Doris and I might see the temple there; .nnd the second time at Kom Ombb for us to inspect thnt temple, nnd also becnuse the wind h',IS blov.. ing so terrificCllly that n"vig"tion W,iS excessively unple"spnt, so \\'e tied up there at "bout one on 1∑10nday and didn't strlrt ;'g:∑in until e;,rly the next (resterdny) morning. Although ,,'e \,'ere ,,'ithin two minutes \~(1lk oL the temple D. <lnd I did not stir off thE) bo"t until five o'clock idlen the "'ina died do..... n. That Kom Crn∑∑bo temple is an extr~ordin;\ry one because it is duplex -one side being dedicnted to n good god -the elder Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk. I prefer the later n,'me bec,luse it sounds like a crocodile, if stlid down in your throat with full value given to nIl the consonnnts. There is one room in a little ch~pel on Sobk's side which is full ofmummied crocodiles -quite the. horrides∑t∑ things I've seen in a-long ~while. ∑-The temple-∑is in ~ most .... ruinous condition, but, ~erhaps, all the more beoutiful for that, ond the s:.tuntion <tnd views fIre superb. D. and I climbed uP. on the ''''reck 6f ,I splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset "nd indulging in a plensHnt melClncholy, and h'id it all to ourselves, ,except for the fc!ith≠ful escort, Hnneen and a sailor, Who dogged our feetsteps. It re"lly is awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here -for they are tired to denth of it, hnving seen it so many times, and they don't go anywhere or do Llnything except stny on the boat und nrr,!nge for us to see the sights. Yesterday morning shortly nfter we left Kom Ombo we found u mile of flamingoes sblnding in ranks and files on the sandbclr5: 
\'ie 'Irr∑i..."ed here about 12:30 yesterday and it \\'(15;) joyful cre\,' th"t tied us up, for most of them live here. Doris and I did the bnz~nr yesterdny afternoon with H,'neen to drive bargains for us ;lnd Amelie ;.nd ;, s,∑ilor in our tr~in. You understand that "the b<Jz,'t1r" in these towns menns f1 long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs ne~rly meeting overbend and tiny shnllow little shops like pigeonholes nIl olong on both sides. We thought the bazaar in Coiro enthralling, but itf~lls short of this 
one though it's much l"rger. This one so reeks of the desert and the 
strange things∑thnt come out of it. You would hnve gone wild over the 

leopard skins and the Soudtlllcsc wec'pons, .,nd the scores 01 thinr.s 
never seen anywhere else.

! This morning, immedi.,tely ulter break:f.'st, D. Clnd I, with H:.neen '4 1 St.C!rted for the d<tm -or the bLl.rr"ge "S it's usu ïï lly c;llled here' F Jones had engaged a carringe :for us at the CatarRct Hotel (opposite i which ""e ure lying ""i th only a narrow ch'lnnel between us), "nd hnd :-. , luncheon put up for us in the native b"sket thnt lOOks just like the 
I
square "'icker cnges birds ,Ire kept in at the bird f:'nciers. In less th,tn five minutes from the time "'e left th,.t very fine hotel courtY:'rt \\'e "';ere in the desert -and a terrible desert, quite unlike the be"ut'~ ~ul one <It Luxor. Ruined habit:ltions "nd ruined cemeteries Ivy ,'long: much of the three miles we drove, and it wouldn't hnve surprised me i{ the least, though I \,ould have been white "vith fe"r, to have seen lio-J' sb,lking <lbout in those desper'ite solitudes. And then sUddenly "ve l ..'ere in the midst of an ench:Jnting little cantonment of pretty bung,,_~ lo\\'s, beClutiful trees '.lnd gardens and verdtlnt terr;,ces, -the settle-! ,nent in "'hieh live the officivls and chief employees who rn.'n;'ge thet b~rr"ge. My wildest imagiriings fell far short of the stunning Find ' bewildering re"lity. Doris <Jnd I elected to wnlk '.lcross the b,.rr:'ge thou~h most people ride on little individual skeleton cars, ench one push~d by a nntive .,long n track (there are two tracks). It is .1 mill~,I quarter long, and there are 180 sluice gates. On the upper side the Kile lies like a c~)lm 'lnke within ten feet 01 the top' of the m<Jsonry;:;: "'hile on the lo'''er side, FIt least :J hundred feet bela'" "nd :lbout in i' the middle of the d"m this morning ""bere several <'d joining sluices ",;e; open there was p thunder and turmoil of wtlters and foam nlmost like 1 Ki~garn Fnlls. At the far' end of tbe barrRge we took n felucc~ nnd ï sniled over to PhilCli, once the IslHnd cc1lled "tbe Pearl of Egypt," b! no\;' so drCi\\'ned by the be' nking up of the \"" ters, th'l t only the very to] of the pnlrn trees sbc)"\"Clbove the \\'ater \\'hich l.,ps the c;,pitc\ls of the" pillars of the temple. When we got back to the bnrrnge we wnlked dovl four or fi~e flights of steps nlong the locks "nd found "nother felucl.l ....∑oiting us, ",'hich Jones h:td sent up, <.lnd in thClt we C;lme do\\'n tbe ri, 
We had hoped to s:lil, but there was such n contr:lry wind the men rowee the \"ay. 
There ~re n rew ~cre ∑sights to be seen tomorro"/, ;.nd on Frid<>y t\∑~ stHl 
on our return trip~ The air' is splendedhere.,. but the \Io'ind blows too much for my complete hnppiness. 
Goodbye, darling. God bless you ond keep you safe. I do so hope you' will go t.o church on EClster. Your Loving Mother.

 
Best Beloved -Since ~y last letter I'v~-been 'so unhappy I 
just couldn't bring ~yself to write. It is nothing that ha~ h~ppenud 
to any of this party, and it's nothing that I feel like writing about; 
though I'll tell you the whole story when I get home. 0 blessed word ≠Home:. But the thing has been so constantly in my mind that I've not ~een 8ble to enjoy anything. 
I dined with Mrs. Bonbright the other evening nt CIRridges. She and Mr. B. live over here most of the time now, and have n place in the country. They were staying in town for n few dnys preparatory to sailing for America ("'hich they did on Saturday) for HOvJard' s ,∑,>edding: He is marrying a Detroit girl named Elizabeth Hodges, Hnd if she is vS lovely us her picture she must be a Queen indeed. We are invited to tea on ~ednesday to meet Norman Sturgis and his wife! -or ruther 
they are nsked to meet us. The Luckrafts nre in town and being aWfully nice to us, and so is Lily Solly. Mrs. Bell is still in America. We've done a lot of motoring through this lovely English country. It's a heavenly time of year to be here, but the weather has been horrid. We motored to Oxford yesterday and on our Way bnc) stopped at Stoke Poges, where Wm. Penn was born, and saW the exquis' Hnd very cheerful churchynrd \-:here Grey '''rote his Elegy. \l'e also . came through Eton and saw scores of Eton boys in their silk hats. Their ends didn't correspond -for almost all of them wore slovenly ~npolished shoes. 
D. and I have been to three picture g<!lleries and h<lve seen such hauntingly lovely things that if it ":eren't for my durling son and hankering to see him, I'd like to Sbl}' here another month just to look at pictures. I must have told you -though I can't remember _ that D and I are going to the York-ihn.ll, as I suppose the lviclcSherry are still at 615, and I hope they'll st8Y there all summer. 
I'll probably write you one more little note before we sail. Don't forget date and ste:lmer -l-ltly 21, Kronprinz \Vilhelm. 'I!e ought to 1 on the 28th. Of course I don't kno'" ",'he the r or no t yo u ,.,' ere pI., nni 
to meet us, or \,'ould be uble to. Sut I'm going to say "Don't". Every extra person onlycadds to poor Cousin T's confusion of mind, we'll.take the first trnin we can for New Hoven. I'll telegrDph yo 
the minute we land. 
I've had so much to trouble me recently, nnd I feel so piffliss, I don't want any flaw in my homecoming. So if you love your Mim you' be sure to ha1,'e done the things I've made <". point of your doing (c:; ing on the D--:.tlcers, and .,'riting those letters) b~fore I get there. 
Goodnight ow..! a million blessings on your dec.:.r he"d, l"y love to JU~k and to Wilson. Your loving Nother. 

Best Beloved≠I learn_that t~c DacSherrys have lefti 615JOrnnge. So Doris and I can go there inste~d of to the York hai1. I a15'0 learn that the Eronprinz Wilhelm ought to reach ~.Y the morning of Tu es d (~ Y Eay 2 7ï Hurrall! :

It Was hard to leave Cousin Theodore -he so hated to ~ee me go. 

offered me the gardener's cottuGe for the SUI:lmer! Even the preser.ce of Cecile who arrived last evening with Terry, did not seem to console him for my departure. H looked so shocking this morning it sent my hevrt into my mouth. 
I'm afraid it's going to be horribly hot in 1:e'... Haven, but ,,'ith escnpe before me I suppose I can stand it. I'm longing for your first letter. Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris ond tell her how much I appreciate her hospitality to you. God bless my boy.

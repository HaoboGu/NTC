 
Darling Gopher -It's more than h,'o "-eeks since I've heard from 
you nnd I'm beginning to be afraid thut u letter must h~ve been lost, 
1\s for me I've \\'ritten you \-,ith the utmost regulnrity, beginning with ;, 
postal from Gib, follo~ed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in 
Naples on the 27th, pursued by another muiled at Alexandria Dec. 2, 
since ~hich I've ~ritten once a week. 1\ letter just brrived from Jack 
Stewart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has written 
you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter". Of course I am wholly 
mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remote≠
ness will begin to be intolerable. 
Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency ond th~ days flit by on the wings of the wind. I bask in constant sunlight, and wenr summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin Theodore persistently refers to me, ....∑hen speaking to Doris, as "Your sister". Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry Burton this morning before breakfust saying thnt he hnd found (in n new sepulchrill chamber he opened n fe'" dflys ngo) Cl red granite s;)rcoph~gus with n recumbent f~Gure carved on the lid. The note further said it would take about t~o dnys to clear "W~y the debris in which it is em≠bedrle~. Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and ~wnit developments. I want to go also, but it isn't fClir to lenve Cousin Ernmn alone so I'm going to stay with her. I think I shall ride p8rt ~?y with them for the s8ke of the ride, and then come b8ck <Jlone \\'ith l-lahmoud J my donkey boy -and possibly one of the crew. When Cousin T., D. & I go out we ~r' quit~ a cavalcade -we three mounted, and three donkey boys and two sailors running beside us. I've come to the reluctant conclusion that my donkey, Sugar J has too sm,!ll a tummy to cinch <J sidest:lddle to. J.ly saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount Bnd hold up the procession and hnve it readjusted. Jones thought it might be the fnult of the soddle, and, in his determination to have me suited J the other day he, assited by biO donkey boys R.nd six of the ere"', s"ddled "nd unsHddled that one sma.ll donkey ,,'ith various sidesaddles "'hile ;.11 Luxor looked on. But no sidesaddle st~ys put for more thnn fifteen minutes on Sugar, so I think I'll have to give him up. I hate to,-he's so pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim. 
Sunday aft~rnoon we took a rHther unusunl ride, not visiting nny ruins 
(which is what we ...1rnast <ll\>'nys do) but riding through miles of cuIti≠vuted ~ields where steam ployghs were at work and the w<lter flowing 
through cemented irrig<lting ditches,-all more modern "nd progressive 
than anything we hnve seen, and quite dull and uninteresting comp<Jred 
with the native methods.

Dori s met some a,,'fully amusing young Englishmen, t,,'o or three of "'hom could actuDlly dance ,,'ell, and I enjoyed myself immensely just tnlkin to people. 
,,'e've just had a Baron rind Baroness Von Bissing lunching with us. He 
is a sort of German translation of Leonard &~con. The resemblnnce is 
too amusing. 'I'e see by the Paris Herald that George Bourne has been 
married. I ..... onder if he will co~e out here on his wedding journey.

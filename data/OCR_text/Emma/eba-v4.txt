There are comparatively few passengers - and 1 have never known ouah pleasant ones. The Hamilton Fisks of Now York - Dr. Doty, the Health Officer of the N. Y. Port, Prs. .7ard Howe Elliot, the daughter of lire* Julia bard Howe - and a iir. Pratt - now American Consul Ceneral at Singapore, and for five years our Minister to Persia - a really cultivated man. We all have tea together in the afternoon, and raake very merry - and we have Mrg. Bend of New York and her two daughters at our table. I asked Mr- Pratt how long Benjamin, former minister to Persia, had lived in that country, and he said 3 years. I said that was rather a short time acquaintance with a country about which to write an exhaustive work. Ho tola me Benjamin had given gre^t offence to tho Shela, and others in his , ook - and that he had seen absolutely nothing of parts
of Persia about which he writes.

Bo aro actually in possession - have started - and made 15 niloe to Bedraeheen, whore wo are now lying. Mary and I flew about this morning doing last things - we lunched at the Gesireh, but went down before lunch on the terrace, to see the Beduin, under convoy of

the tug, go by, on her way to abov? the bridge, which opens at one o'clock* Just as we reached th* terrace, T saw away down th* river, the tug pulling out, and our "beduin" stately, tall, and shapely in her tow. Several people gathered on the terrace to see her go by - and I heard her pronounced the "handsomest craft on the river". Immediately after lunch, when poor Theodore had finished all his backsheesh*, we drove above the bridge, and went aboard. There was hurry and scrambling for 15 minute*, as our trunks were literally turned upside down, and sent back empty to the hotel to bo kont for us, until we come down. In the aidst of it, Mrs. and ;!iss Taylor arrived for a parting visit. Then thare was the,"debbil to payM as dear old Salah would say, as Theodore

Vo have aado about 18 miles - and are somewhere between Bod* rosoholn and Vesta. Yho tug proves a worthless thing. 8ho can make about 2 alias with us, an hour, without any assistant# from us * but if wo have a wind that at all fills our sails, wo sail right on to her and sha teas to oast off. Various "disagreaens" have developed themselves, tho moot important of which is old Henna, our cook, who was with ue for
2 winters on tho Herodotus has taksn fright at the range in his kitchen,

and thinks ho can do nothing with it, although ho makes muoh bettor broad with it, than 1 have ever known him do before. And, we greatly need tho forgotten sideboard - and many rather necessary things have been overlooked. However, we are so pretty and convenient, that we are quite ashamed of ourselves in complaining of anything, ivy room is entirely charming * and so are all the bedrooms in their pretty chintss and simple fittings * and the saloon would be a charming interior any whore - with its Morris green brocades and art fabrics. Then the big upper doek is entirely perfection, with its pretty rugs, its big brown

and easy chairs, with their bright yellow and black cushions and pillows in bandana rtuff*. But beet of all, the

man da earth than our Bale Full, who for the first time in his life is 1st Captain. He has been twice with us as 2d Captain and we hare alwaySsaid he should be captain of our dahabeah when it wan built.
He Is sueh a fine specimen of a calm, serene Mohammedan, and has a gentle personal dignity I haws newer seen equalled. He is a Nubian,
-p.	,,i.
knows the riwer thoroughly, and we could trust him with everything we hare. The boat will now be his house summer as well as winter - and he will get £3. a month and during the summer fsed himself - 1 think I am as pleased as he is. He has chosen an admirable crew - I never •aw so good a one on the Nils - and in their brown cardigans with
"Beduin" in blue letters aorosa the breast, they look very well.

for several days, it soened to be no reason that wo should not go on in the ease alow way. 3o Theodors went aboard the tug - found that the engineer in order to "ess in the boiler” as he said, had taken off the
cylinder head, and then found a loose nut kicking about somewhere, and said if he moved their lives would be in danger. There was. nothing to do but to leave her, which w* did, declining to give the man 2 oars as he dished us to do, to paddle back to Cairo, jay warm and beautiful -sailed for nearly 2 hours in a very light wind and think we have made about 10 miles, bn dsck until nearly 7 o'clock, watching the radiant moon-rise and the colors on the Gebel Abu-Fedah chain.

employment of time to read, or work, or look at anything but this strange country - with its simplicity of feature, the changing life of the banks of the river, - one of the most interacting things is the ferry boats - with their loads of men, women, children, and ev*ry description of animal. They are common working sail boats - their sails sometimes so tatt9rad and chiffonnee that one wonders there can be any propelling power about them. Then tney cannot often approach the low shores, and men and women unceremoniously kilt up their clothes and wade to shore, driving their animals before then, or dragging them

but in spite of all the dust penetrated everywhere - though to a much lees dogma than in any other boat I have been on. Across the river,

the sand sbseursd the eight of the mountains at times - and 7 was sorry for Ohs Ceokitss, whs wers swarming on the sands, starting for their various excursions - for 2 or 3 steamers are in - and of course their passengers cannot wait for more favorable weather. Ilary and I this nornlng climbed up the high bank , with the intention of walking back into the country • but one skirts blew over our heads, our hats off onr heads - and our eyes were blinded with sand - so that we soon gave up the contest and came home, glad to finish our walk on the sheltered deck. Salah came to se9 us soon after our arrival, very proud cf uo, and ef our sailing record. Ho is almost willing to let us beat his 2enet~el Nil - M. Goleinschief*e boat, of which he has charge. Old Mohammed Hohaseib also came one evening - excessively pleased - and we presented our little gifts to him. Theodore reports Karnak in the hands of the Kxcavation Society - I have not yet seen it.

Wo have had a lovely week at Assouan - tVie pleasantest I hawe over known - at our same old landing, with the tame views before us, we felt quite at home. Assouan has greatly improved ^inoe we were here, the river front has been faced vith stone, and steps tn ade here and there to the walrer.

he had ehowa him the photograph of this Turin picture, and quite oon-

Then ve drove about the town, with ite handsome well ehaded streets and modern houees, and piotureeque river bank, and were quite delighted with it - but long before we had flniehed eur drive, one of the horses being rather restive broke hie traoee, and we were forced to leave the carriage - Nettle and I taking a cab te the hotel, and Theodore and Clarence walking. #e are having a dull evening - in our big gloomy rooms - Theodore is not well - seems te have taken eold, and has been sleeping ever since dinner.

Florence Talylor came to dinner, and has gone to the Opera with Theodore, Nettie and Clarence, to hear Lohengrin. The theatres have been closed for 2 days, on account of the dreadful catastrophe. This wonting, I could hardly drive to the Flower market at the Madeline, on account of the carriages ranged around it, and the front draped in black.

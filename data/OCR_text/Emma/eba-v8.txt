We found the U.S. Transport which we saw at Gibraltar just arrived, and one of our big white war vessels came along behind us - but we did not learn her name. The former was bound for Vanilla, and the latter for China. At Maples, we fell in with i r. and krs.

We spoke as we passed - Lr. Sayee saying that he would be at til Kab until the 19th - where we will see him. We did not stop at Edfou as the wind was so good - but we went on the sand just this side of it for •. few minutes, and sailed until 7:30. i#ann and very dry tonight.

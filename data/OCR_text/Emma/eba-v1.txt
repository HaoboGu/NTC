that wo bo allewad to eopy this Journal of hor llfo on tho Nile, primarily in ordor that wo might have on rooord In tho Egyptian Dopartmont of tho Uuooua tho many foots which it contains relating to tho arohaoologloal work of Theodore M« Davis, from tho results of which tho Museum has received such valuable material through his various gifts and under the terms of his will.
As a member of his f«nlly9 Mrs. Andrews accompanied Ur. Davis on his annual visits to Egypt for a period of more than twenty years 9 and the eharmlng description which she gives of their river-life on the "Be da win" 9 familiar to many of us who enjoyed their hospitality, is certainly worthy of a wider public and mere permanent form in print9 •- though she could not be prevailed upon to consider this.

There had Just passed over Trance, or rather the south of France, one of the worst mistrals ever known and houses in \vignon and Kitanos blown down, ships unable to enter or le-.vr tho port or "ar-soilles for days, snow at Nine etc. so that our disappointtper.t in regard to seeing Avignon, hiernes and Arise, which had planned to do on our way down to Marseilles, and which my illness prevented, was mitigated.

1 had a visit from Dr. Uurison, and busied nyself writing letters* Mohammed Saleh appeared at breakfast, with the huge Inevitable bou-quet, and h remarkable struoture in sweets which he sailed a "Christ-■as cake", and which 1 put by for afternoon and asked Sir Frederick and Lady Hughes and hiss Gibbs to cobs in, and so disposed of it.
tfe have decidua against the steamer — first Kiss Gibbs baoked down — then they went to look at dahabeaho, and became at once infatuated, and after visits to many Theodors decidsd upon the "Nubia" belonging toyPrince Achmed, an iron boat, with an excellent reputation for speed, and with pretty fittings, and very good beds.
Her model and fittings were so superior to those of any others that we saw, that in spite of her high price, Theodore deoided upon her.

Mohammed went at once delightedly to work, and is now very busy with his preparations for our departure, and is arranging for our comfort in a thousand ways. One of my special cares at present is to prevent him from making a financial ruin of himself, as he insists upon buying too many things and too much of everything for us. *e hope to get off on Saturday, if a favorable wind blows.

outside to our unpraotised ayes did not promise much. How-
and	*84
ever Oaorgatta had packed all our belongings, and wa ware more or lass ready - our own trunks, and innumerable big hampers, mysterious rolls of wraps and carpets, were all piled in the hall by Our doors, and klary and I rushed off to two or three shops near the hotel to buy

It wae so delightfully exhilarating to be thus starting out Into the unknown, In the midst of ao much plonsant preparation* Our driver carefully picked hie way between groups of kneeling camels, and flooks of buffalo, sheep and children - then through the narrow streets of the village beyond, between the walls of the low mud houses, their occupants mostly lying or squatting on the ground in front of them.

the bright day, so /nil of novelty and pleasure - and the young moon about b days old made the night, whan it had descended, brilliant.
Uur first dinner was a graat success - the table very pretty with its candlest and tha white, green and gold china. rfs had been told of the prowess of our cook * and here was a luxurious dinnsr, admirably cooked, worthy ef a chef - ue all exclaimed that if we were going to live in this manner for two months, we would go off of the dahaboah a party of hopeless dyspeptics. tie played a game of cribbage after dinner, and late in the evening h.

This, bunday morning, 1 was awakened about 7 o'clock by tha stir of gstting under way again. After our good breakfast we went on deck to enjoy the fascinating scene - but the light breeze soon increased almoet to a gale - and 1 me first driven below, soon followed by the rest, quite blown to pieces. So had to take in one aft sail, and furl nart of our glorious gib main sail, which with its greet towering billowing white breast oaken our Hubia look like some living thing. It

Beni-soef is 73	milao	from Cairo, and	M.	Salah	says	our run of 12 houro
from Cairo	here,	is tho best ono	he	ewer made,	and he has been 20
years on the river. Miss Kdwards in "A Thousand Wiles’* etc., says they took 10 daye coming here, and were 3 daye in getting away.
1 stayed below all the day - sitting in the eebin and staring through the windows ut the strange, if not attractive scene beside us, of two boats loading with sugar cane - trains of camels coming down ever the steep sandy bank and depositing it, and then scrambling back. A number of fellaheen eoon made their appearanee, and squatted down in the sand	to lock at us.	A	group	of mother and two children
fascinated	me.	The woman with the	usual	dark	blue drese, dingy with
dirt, her arms and neck and fingers covered with ornaments that looked as if they might be gold - the children with mereet rags of garments, and covered with flies, hung about her like young animals - the smaller one standing nursing - and bugging at hir mother1s breast like a
young oalf. Georgette went outside with sons curiosity, and spoke
u
to thorn, but tho woman's raannor was rather thraatsAlng, ud oho i«nd away with hsr childron. Too of tho man hod distaffs ohlsh thsy twirl -sd diligsntly, making thread * a bo vs on tho bank, beyond tbs fsrost of grandly wooing palms, a mils or two away, lay tha village sf bsnlsoef, with 10,000 inhabitants, and a shsik of its own. About 3 o'clock wo pushod off, flying tho merest lit^lo handkerchief of a sail with tho wind lulled, and wo wont on under the big sail until about 8 o'clock, when the Captain sent word through i<. rSalah, that he orould like to tie up for tho night - that thorn "was one big mountain" and tho currant bad. Vo wore soon made fast to tho bank - tho crow had enoloood their dock with canvas - a lantern was swung, rugs and blankets taken out -and thay gathered about th© mutual supper bowl.- nftorwards taking out tholr curious drums and tambourines, and giving us our first concert,
strange droning music in a minor key.

The wind was so high last night, that wo laid quietly by until an early hour tnis morning. After breakfast 1 wont on dock, and banked in the delicious sunlight, interested in everything 1 saw, until the wind became so strong 1 came bOlow. behind us we saw the sand storm coming, and our little aft tail is ordered to be furled -the waves are really high, the sand obscures the shore, and we are tearing along at a tremendous pace. I hear below the4confusion above, the shouting of orders and shrieks of the wind, and it is very exciting - but we cannot stop, and not make any use of this wind, so wo

106 miles from Oairo, waking this distance in two days, in bpite tf

our frequent stepping. At one o'clock the captain sent word that he would rather step until the wind fell a little - which we were very glad to hear, as we were able to eat our lunoh in peace. The sailors made ns fast to the high black	mud bank, and a.	Salah reported	a town
net far off	- but the sand was	blowing so, that	none of us had	the
courage to attesipt walking. Theodore took to his stateroom for a sleep - and	Mary and Georgette	clambered up the	bank, and ewer	it a
little way,	and came back with	a bunch of mustard flowers, and	seas
white clewer blossoms, and a new and beautiful kind of grass. Numbers ef lovely white and gray birds were flying about - much like our sand pipsrt. About 4 o'clock the wind fell and we pushed off, flying only the little sail from the felueem. I etayed down in the cabin all the afternoon, perched up on one of the divans near a window, watching the shifting scenes on either side, sometimes with a glass, of mud banks and villages, ef palm fringed chords, of sterile sandy hills * the women eternally filling their water jugs, and walking off in stately grace, with these balanced on their heads - the storks standing about on their long legs. Never shall I forget that picture I saw - a perfect silhouette against a clear yellow sunset sky - of a group streaming along the high bank - two or three women and children - a man on a donkey, with a child behind him - another young donkey full of life and pranks kicking up his heels behind him - then a dog and three or four sheep, all streaming along the narrow path - showing perfectly black against

1 aay now 1 think describe our dahabeah, and her belongings - ^ in which we are oo comfortable, that it is a delight to think it must last two months - and one wonders if it is possible that during that time we ean.gver become, after the manner of the average tlrosomo human being, weary of it, or find anything to oomplain of! tfe find tho boat everything and more, than wo expected - It ie very clean, and in good order - the bede rre delightfully comfortable, and all the arrangements are very geod - Uy room, which ocoupios the etern, is really palatial, with its two bede, one of whiqh we use for a lounge, its two big arm ehalre, ite cheat of drawers with the mirror above, the little reading table at the head of my bed, and all the Space, to eay nothing

f
are equally good, though smaller, and there is beside a room for yahora-med 3. Our cabin, which serves as both dining room and sitting room, is about 12 x IS feet, with a bookcase, two side boards with mirrors
above, divans on each side, easy chairs etc. The (prevailing color of

If one of them wants a drink, he leans ever the aide of the boat and oooops up a tin full of water - thoy generally wash their hands after eating, and many of then rinse their mouths. After their last meal of the day thoy smoko n pipe called hubble-bubble - one pipe earring for all, and handed ffom one person to another.

They all have the moe$ singular buildings or towers t which are really pigeon houses - and the pigeons in this part of the country must be numbered by millions •
Thdee towns are lofty - somewhat pyramidal in shape, and have very curious rounded looking battlements, each one of which is a pigeon house.

We put off from Hallieneh very early yesterday morning in at fine wind - but it grew lighter and lighter until about 1 o'clock we were left ** a painted ship" upon the water. Then we wished we had

The day has baon delicious really hot - and wo had up an awning for the first tine, and I doffed ■y far cloak. The river wrfs a mir*er - and from every direction came the melancholy cry of the shadoof workers. The shores are lined with shadoofs - which are sinplo appliances for raising the water of the river to the level of irrigation. Two polos are set up, four or five
* * fcOis-
feet apart, Oftd several feet above the river - on a cross pole between those is balanced a long polo, weighted at one end by a large mass of dried mud* and from the other is suspended a bucket made of skin or leather. If the river is low, two or three of these are plated one above the ether • at aaoh level a basin is scooped out for the reception of the water, and below it stands a man who sinks the bucket in the water, where it is filled, then letting go of it the weight at the other end lifts the bucket of water, which is received by a man air the next level, who empties it either into the irrigating ditch, or into the receptacle above for water. The men are generally naked,
except for a cloth about the loins, and leek like dripping bronze
✓
statues, and they have a peculiar cry as they «*ork, consisting of ^
ST 4 notes which we find impossible to get, in a minor key with a peculiar quaver, and the effect ie desolate and melancholy in the extreme
«Mf «k» hniml—s **prasslcn of ttiair joyless and hopeless lloit. In the quiet ef the evening, it is especially sad, and when the land is at all sell cultivated, the shadoofs an* only « far yards apart.
*to*t an important part the Nils plays In this strange country! aside fran its supplying the soil, and being the sole naans of cultiva-
tion, its aud is ss useful - they sake their pots and dishes sf it, build their houses end fence* ef it - the upright poleo of the shadoofs are generally nade ef bunches of corn stalk about which the mud is moulded, and toon bated hard and dry in the sun - they use it for mortar and plaster, and it takes the place of wood in dotens of ways.
We started very eetly this Homing palling - and the men making suoh a noise from neeesslty, that Theodors gars ordern there should be no more polling before 7 o’clock. In epite of light winds and dead sales, we reeehtd Keneh (40ft miles from Cairo) about 2 o'clock. Wo landed opposite the town, and took donkeys for Dendsrah, half an hours ride sway.

The rock tcanary in tha neighborhood of the cataract is somethin*, very wonderful* Huge strange masses of granite broken, and heaped together in wildest eon-fusion - hardly a sharp edge or angle anywhere - all worn and rounded by attrition, and the notion of water through enormous ages. Where tha fiver has come in oontaet with tha rock, it has covered it with a deposit of lten - and the strange forms into which it is worn, seoeped out into giant cauldrons, and mighty sockets, give them tha look of iron castings.

We stopped at the small island of Shcllal - and Theodore and K.S. climbed to a height, where a good view of th« cataract was to be had.

Thursday* Jan. 23d.
On our getting out of our felucca this t-crning at Assouan, we were met by the youthful and conical agent of the Consular :Vgent at Luxor, who in hie boyleh timid manner begged M.S. to ask us to come to the Consulate and have coffee with him\ 7e had seen him hovering on our skirts on several occasions, and knew this thing was imminent, st we aflcanted with the best possible grace we could assume, and Theodore kindly turned him over to me to entertain, so ! walked along with him and M.8. keeping up a certain amount of talk - while Theodore and I'ary walked behind indulging in the most amusing criticisms of me and my

ian Army numbers about 13,000. All of the officers speak most highly of these Soudanese soldiers - even affectionately - they are toll* well

By tho time wo had inspooted tho quarters, tho danoors worn la full swing - and wo walked about looking at thorn. Every tribo danood by themselves - and two or three drummers formed tho centrs of wash ring of danoors. Their drums wore native, as rude kind of Barrel, with a skin stretched on top, and drummed with tho hand, in a particularly tolling and exciting way. Tho dance began with a slow shuffling awkward oircling about tho drummers - each nan hold some stifc or weapon, and as they warned to tho work, each seemed to do what ho
j
pleased in the way of drumming and shouting. 1 can imagine that in tho native dress, or rather ornaments, it might bo weird and Horrible, but it seemed a trifle civilised and perfunctory - though we were told they keep it up for hours every Friday, with great enjoyment, and long after 1 was in hod, the distant sound of their drumming came to ay ears. The officers walked down to our boat with us and said goodbye, we earns

home in the twilight, the oars dipping into the enln pink rater, and keeping time to the wild, low ehanting of the men - the young moon trembling in the soft sky, and throwing a silver trail across the river.

At bail pact aight o*clock this morning ac I vac harrying with my dressing* I heard the anchor pulled up* a babel of voices subside* and Theodore calling ue to hurry out and witness our departure* Tea mere dahabeahe arrived laet evening* and ac 1 vent on deak* 1 felt the firet shiver of movement* and one of these dahabeahe pulled up behind ue to taka our plaoe as ve moved away. Days age* our big beem and sail in vhioh we had taken such pride* vac taken dovn and laahed alang the length of the dahabeah* and the small after sail put in its place* The planks vers taken up in seotione on the lamer deck* ee giving the 5 sailers on eaoh side a plaoe to sit and row - there they were* the ears in their hands* the ropes were hauled* and ve pulled cut into the eurrent* and began our elov progress dovn the river* Hew sorry ve felt to leave it all behind! and it so sued as if the day before ue vould be interminable. One after another of the pleasant land marks vers left behind* and then a bend of the river shut it all away from our lingering eyes. There has been a light head wind all day - and against this our men roved from the time of starting* until 12 o'clock* when they rested two houro - then took to
(11 half past six, bringing us about 12 alias froa
Assouan. :Our sympathies bars boon sxoitsd for thoa« far ths of fort saws a grant KWh.

During most of the time they sang. During all tho tine we have been on the river, wo have had a south wind only for half or those quarters of an hour - and the prospect of roving book to Cairo, stems a gloomy one today! The downward progress of a dah&bsah on the river, is a most absurd and
.1
humiliating one. Unless when rowed, or the unusual south wind fills the sail, ths boat drifts, apparently helpless - and we have been
ernused and exasperated today to see the Kubia almost putting her nose into ths mud bank on one side, then backing with her stern into the opposite shore, or going stem first down the river, or standing foolishly across it! and the points of tho compass become hopelessly con? fused in your mind, and I am beginning to have some anxieties about Theodore, fearing the inaction and slow progress may prove hard to boar. He ought to have another man with him. Going on deck after dinner we feund every man almost of the crew already wrapped in their
rugs, and asleep on the deck - I am sure we none of us slept as soundly %s they did that night.

A eool wind was bloving, but an intense sua shining, against whose too ardont rays vs had prottoted ourselves with veils, parasols and puggarees and blue glasses. The same pleasant crossing in tfts feluooa to the shallow shores beyond, morose which wo wore borne to dry land by our men, as yesterday - then again morose the vide stretch of yellow sand to the high embankment , and than the sharp turn at the mud village, filled with troops of little bare bronte children, and then the long ride through the rleh barley fields - for the Theban crops are especially rioh - wo paoe the Colossi, and turn to the right, and riding along the desert edge of this groat necropolis, ve took our way through and up tho path of a mountain torrent vhleh seemed a very valley of desolation - not a living thing - not the faintest trace of vegetable life,

with {base jugs on thslr hoads - though far in the roar, they stoppid along cheerfully over the sharp stones with their bnre feet, and if you looked at one, she would immediately show every tooth she had in a broad emile, Occasionally we pulled up In the "shadow of a great rock" for a moments roet - and I thought ae I am continually doing in this oountry, how natural the Eastern imagery of the Bible seems! At last we same te a kind of eul da sac in the yellow rocks, where is the tomb of Rameeis 9th, and hare we dismounted, for beside seeing the tomb we ware going to lundh there. Our patient little donkeys were left In the blinding heat outside, while the men and guides huddled themselves together in the shade of the inclined entrance, while ve took possession of the cool, gaily painted portal - our sumpter mule was unpacked, rugs laid down, camp stools i*nd table spread, and an elaborate lunch ready. Our three little water carriers squatted near us - girls not over 9 or 10 years of age - pretty thingc they all were, with their beautiful
eyee, white teeth and pleasant voices. One of them called Fatima so
v
endeared herself to Mary, that she has promised to come to the dahabeah tomorrow, to be painted. After our lunch, we lingered and rested until four o'clock - afraid to venture out in the heat - and we walked down the descending corridor o' the tomb examining the strange paintings.
Then we went a short distance to the well known and often described tomb of Seti 1st commonly called "Belgone's Tomb”, from the fact that

Strange monsters and huge serpents writhe along the walls, and guard tha entrances. The cheerful realistic representations of every day human life, whioh th tombs of the earliest dynasties show, ore not hare. In their plaee, evil demons and shapes represent the more modem ideas, of the struggle of the soul with evil - and on these walls ths whole elaborate story of the judgment and trial of the soul after death is given - Anything wore strangely impressive than thesa great chambers in the heart of the mountain, with their brilliant and elaborate decoration, cannot be imagined. And the thought of the amount and difficulty of the labour, was overpowering, vfoat a commentary too, are these strange tombs, hid away in this wild and almost inaccessible valley, on the stability of human effort and ambition!

they were found a few years since, and conveyed to the Boulak museum, and now lie open to the gaze of the tourist of the 19th century! It is thought now that the temples known as Psdinet Abou, ths Rameseeum, Temple of Gooraah, Deir-el-Bahari otc., which stand along this grsat stretch of desert land, lying along the mountains here, separated by no great intervals, so that one can easily be seen from the other, are the Uastabas, or mortuary ohapels of their kings, buriec Deyona ana above them in the valley of the Bab-el-Moulak.
On coming out of the tomb of Seti 1st, we went to that of Ramesis 5d or Brun's Tomb as it is often called, or the Tomb of the Harpists, from the admirable paintings so well known of men playing harps. The nish and execution of this tomb is far inferior to that of Seti 1st. Here as at Philae are numerous Creek "graffiti", showing that they were open to the inspection of travellers in the times of the Ptolemies. Our ride down the valley was much more pleasant in the cool of the afternoon, and we stopped at the Ramasseum and
rods about it, seeing it very well in this way. The most gigantic

Another wery warm day, and we devoted the morning to hunting antiquities* At one of the shops we fell In with an Englishman by the
none of Chester, who has spent 21 winters in Egypt - and has some accurate knowledge of antiques - as he buys for the British Museum,
and Aehsiolean in Oxford - he had promised to come and look at our purchases* Then we went to Mohamad kohasslbs, and bought som^ things.
These men newer keep their best things on exhibition - nor do they produce them unless they are very sure of their customers. They keep them in safe hiding either in or out of the house. This morning Mohassib took us into a small back room up stairs - with a bed in it,
and lifting one of the mattresses showed us two long mummy cloths
v
with figures and inscriptions on them. They were from the rmxnmies of Amenophls 3d and his queen - and he asked £700 in our money, or 3500 francs for them. U.S. has a knowledge of these things, and pronounces generally as to what is spurious and genuine, and keeps an sagls eye on us, to sea that we are not cheated - and when he says quietly, •you don't want that Governor", Theodors will not buy.

He says the papyrus is a portion of the Ritual of the book of the Dead, but as there may be some other matter with it, advises T. to submit it to an expert in London, and says he will give him a card of introduction to the head of the Egyptian department of the Vuseum. After he wont away, wo had only time for a charming row of a mile or two. There are several dahabe&he here now - some bound up, and four like ourselves bound down, Ur. Chesters among the number. It looks very pretty and gay* After dinner U.b. came to us and asked if we would like to go up to hie tent on the bank, as he had someone reading the Koran there -and explained that when at Luxor he always had this done. So up we vest, and found chairs had been carried up for us and rugs - and eat for half an hour listening to throe men seated on a rug, singing or intoning the Koran, with that swinging of the body which seems to be necessary to a recital of the Koran. Several Arabs were gathered a-bout the door of the tent, to.3. and R£is Achaed were sitting on the ground in devout attitudes, occasionally responding to the reading by a slowly drawn out "Allah”, The principal reader would recite in-oredibly fast for a time, then one or other o*' the men on either side of him would taka it uo, beginning in a strange high falsetto tone,

Our last morning at Luxor found us very buoy f immediately after breakfast Beats, the photographer came to tele the picture of our men and dahabeah. The eun was intensely hot, the awnings having to be lifted, he was in a great hurry to get back to his atelier, and everybody seemed excessively stupid about it* After he.had gone Theodore strolled into the town, which he reported very quiet and stupid, as all the dahabeahs but two, and Cook's steamers had gone off early.

As everywhere in these Hgyptian temples, and in a greater degree here, the mind is oppressed with the thought of the
of toiling workmen, slaves and captives, and in such a climate. By good right, these vast halls should be haunted continually by their wails of suffering and despair - and how stupendous the might, and how

We chose the semi-darkness of this corridor, dirty and dusty as it was, as a high wind had sprung up9 driving the dust in a blinding fashion.

Chester for a stroll along the cliffs - while f’ary and I stayed on deek, watching through the glass the numerous birds who make their nests in the crevices of the rocks - sometimes we would swing so near to these perpendicular cliffs, as almost to touch. The wind blew harder and harder - and we made for the opposite shore which was low and sandy, and there made fast. *'r. Chester followed us, and he -nd Mr. Cowper came in their snail boat to pay us a visit, and we asked them to stay to lunch, which they did - so that the dull day was most pleasantly broken.

A calm hot day - our won liavo worked nagtiif i cently, and we are now about 12 miles of Cairo. tfe have p cNd and settled a great many things and hnva spent most cr the cay on dec! in spite of the heat. The Weydoum pyramid appeared early this morning - then Deshour and finally the well known outlines of uizeh - and I began to realise that the delicious \‘ile life was over. It made us very uncomfortable
to see the men sitting in the intense sunlight hour after hour working

seemed as if his magnificent strength told at once and he would put new life in the crew. The singer sang his best songs continually, and got off some extraordinary vocal gymnastics. W.b. even took a hand at the oars once in awhile - and two or three times Rais Aohmed took a pull himself. About 5 o'clock a fine south wind came up -
; -jr •
both eaile were hoisted - tho tired men put away their oars - the hatches went down, and we were glad to see them resting. tfe had hoped to stop at Sakkarah for a day * but we are loo much behind time. I have told M.3# some days ago, that when we got into Cairo 1 should givs the men a good dinner - with the idea of which they are well pleased. Soon after 5 o'clock I dc. cried the minarets of the Citadel, and for a time, as the soon was bright, we thought we could wake Cairo this evening. But tho river was so low, and 00 many sand banks, to be avoided, that the Captain pulled up at bedrasheyn for the night, having made over 50 miles today.
Friday. Feb. 28th.
tfe arrived at 9 o'clock this morning - the quiet south wind of last night has increased and developed into a respectable kamseen,
as we drew up beneath th<t high encircling walls of a palace enclosure
114
iM the Gain side, the waves were making pest us, and the driving
s
wind carried everything movable before it.	Gan oral and formal eon-
gratalatiana were exchanged amongst all, from Rais Aohaod and M.S. damn ta the crew on our safe arrival* Theodora and M*3* at onea mailt ashore and drove into town for our mail, and to seeure rooms and money * While Mary and I, having survived the misery of dismaa-v tling the dahabeah, and vatohad the last disposition of our many belongings, and newly acquired posaaesiona and antiquities, vent on deck where the close awnings protected us from the stifling hot wind* Before 1 was reedy to leave the cabin, ties sen cams and said the men were at their dinner, but they would not eat until I came out* Surprised at the celerity or the proportions for the feast, and the hour ehosenf X went out and found the lower deok enclosed with its awnings, a veritable table occupying most of it, and the men actually seated in chairs and on benches about it! looking so conscious and silly, but as happy as children. They rose at once, all their white teeth chining in their smiling brown faces, and be* gan a triple cheer, led off by iiane, ending with "tink you, tink you, my lady" repeated again and again, and followed by some undistin-guishable English sentence, in vhich, 1 suppose, h,S, had coached them. Then they eat down and began devouring such a meal as they never had before. There were platters of goo i meat and vegetables up and down the table - two chickens, good broad, a great pudding of rice and milk, oranges and coffee - and I don’t think a grain of rice, or a shred
of meat was left on the table.
Then they had cigarettes, and renewed

Ths morning was threatening, and we dared not venture upon our excursion to Ravello. ttary and Theodors went down tie cliff and into the town for a walk, and 1 went with the proprietor into the strange old chapkl, where a snuffy, vheecy priest, the last survivor •f the former monks, and so fat that I wondered how he could climb the stairs to this place, was holding a service, vrith n congregation of e do ten or more. ^?e went into the gallery, an' looked down on them, and ay companion responded devoutly and sonorously through the service. Then I went out into tho email cloister* with its prstty interlacing Moorish colbnnade, and beyond to -i greet cave, with lofty projecting roof, where is a huge crucifix, and the Lvo thioves on their crosses, making a most strange effect. Regular stations lend to it from the town below. Then 1 went out into the narrow terraces of tho garden, which were full of flowers - gny geraniums, nasturtiums, hyacinths, mignonette and other flowers. ”he b«“»s were busy amonr them, and the air so sweet with fragrance - but the cloudr. were eo U reatening I did not venture to climb to the orange grove above.

I was happy to be once more in tVds old city, where we arrived at 3 o’clock. The journey from faples was deli.htful - through superb mountain scenery - the railway following vary nearly the course of the ancient Via Appia. First, farewell glimpses of Vr. Vesuvius and Ischia, and that incomparable coast - then through the plain of the important river Volturno with the grand mountains sweeping up from it on either
lat
iMka! tn splendid majesty * their height* crowd hare end there with suppressed monasteries, ruined castles, crumbling tower* and walls,
with ancient Reman towns nestling along the cliffs and ravines* Then Into the great plains of the Campania, an enormously fertile district under high cultivation now ealled the Terra di Lavoro, then through the valley ef the Garigliano - then that of tho Jacco, and at last wa were approaching Rome with its Caropagnla scenery - tho Sabine and Alban Mountains on our right, with the arches of the Aequa Felloe, and Ae<yaa Marcia et riding along the nlain - and the Volt clan fountains with glim pees of the tea on our left*
If I were a man 1 should make an expedition through all this eountry* T watild see many of the old towns with, their pelygcnal walls, and old temples and ampitheatres - and 1 would visit those old monasteries especially that of Monte Casino, with tho \bruggi fountains lying opposite on the east across the narrow plain. Thin would be fascinating with its chanele and marbles, its carvings and its pictures* It was founded by St* Benedict in 529 on the site of an at ci ;nt teranle of A-polio* Thn priceless library must well be 'worth a visit. It now con-taint 10,000 volumes, including many rara editions, an! specimens of early printing. Among the numeroiws and valuable fi£ preserved in the archives, are the commentary of Origan on the 3pictle to I he Rorrane, dating from the 6th century - splendidly illuminated MSS, documents of kings, popes, etc* bulls, letters etc. There now remain in this convent 30 monks who share the charge of th^> library and archives, and educate theological students.

All theeo rows of pioturesque houses dipping their foundations in tha flood of tha yellow Tiber, which gave such a charm to the banks of tha river, are now being deoourously tucked away end hidden beyond tha eelid and handaome stone quays now building on both sides of the river* Wa all burst into a howl of indignation however, whan we came to tha Ponte 3.

In t*ie afternoon we drove up to the little old church of 3.

In the afternoon we drove to S.

I*ext to it, and apparently part of it is the old aachioolated i’ozzi ialace. a.

Day before yesterday was a vary busy «*y* * let ef peeple coming in in the morning among them t r. Duatheme with a lovely little basket of primroses and forget-me-nots fresh from the country.

In the evening Theodore and I dlnsd with the Lldderdalse - a trifle heavy - but as I know so little about Bngllsh society X always fesl like assisting in a novel, when X gS lute it — and like to study the people. L'r. L. was as delightful as he always is.
The next day Constance left us to pay a visit to some friends Just outside London. In th$ evening Theodore, Vary and T dined with Sir yilllan and Lady Farrar. We had a charming evening, though I was too tiffed to talk much. Lady Farrar in the midst of her large family of grown sons and daughters, was as sweet an English matron, as one would wish to see.

and we doubted if we could get up tho river * that now we gat tha sights of the inundation, and it is most interesting to us. The present con* dition is what prevailed in September.

It was too, tho darkest day I ever saw in Egypt, without a gleam of sun-shins, and a strong oold wind blowing, and 1 was uncomfortable in my chair, with no exorcise to warm mo. We visitad the tomb of Unas, Ttah Hotsp, and lunched on tha terrace of Mariettas, with the dogs, and cate

no movement - ve might haws baon travailing on a placid rivers Nov since leaving Gibraltar a fav hours ago, tha aaa has bean growing heavy and I find writing difficult. It has bean very warm too - and I have as yet not worn any of my winter clothes, I have had a bad cold too -
i
one of my old fashioned croupy colds, and stayed in bed 2 days, Theodore too, has had a cold, and does not get over it - because he won't be carofUl. I have been moot comfortable - having the Captain's room and have enjoyed my little sitting room much, where we have our friends to tea. This afternoon we had Mrs. tfoodworth anJ her daughter and Mr.
T^m Maitland. They had been ashore at Gibraltar in the wet, and were
X
glad enough to coma in for a cup of good tea. For it began to pour with
rain this morning and by 9 o'clock when we dropped anchor at Gib, it was almost invisible because of the rain. #e had hoped to see or hear something of tha tfilaona - but if they wore there, they could not face the weather, I discovered an old Columbus friend on board this afternoon - Mary Bates! and she has bean spending an hour or so with me this svaning - and wo hnve bean talking of old times and people -

So wa started out to see the Imenhotsp tomb, the sun wee tremendously hot, and ws ought not to have ventured out in such heat so soon after eating.

The sun rery bright all day, but wind cold - with a touch of an aarly spring day in the north, which was very pleeaant. On Saturday we sent the uerrish, our third officer as we cell him, a splendid blue bleak Nubian from Aewdn who has been with ua for four years, down to tfaata for our nail; he did not get back until late yesterday, something being wrong with the trains.

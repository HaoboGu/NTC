most amusing parrots it has ever been my good fortune to meet. There were no second class passengers - so we had our chairs carried down there, and lived there the rest of the voyage, nuite to ourselves. We came to the Hotel Royal where we stayed with Charlie and Nellie Wilson seven years ago - and are fairly comfortable. We start tomorrow on a pilgrimage to Madrid, to sea its great pictures - and Theodore has asksd a young man, a fellow passenger, whom he has talked to a good deal and become interested in, to go with us.	We drove out to see some
races this afternoon, as we will have one or two days hare on our way back, to show Nettie the island.

oigaretteo - and the only thing that saved his boxes of favorite cigars
\
was the word Spain branded on the boxes. They dove to the bottom of my trunk and hauled out my case of homeopathic medicines - and had a solemn pow-wow over it. Then they soiled ny camera that Jones was carrying - insisted on having the case opened, and were too much afraid of taking out the camera themselves. I took it out - took off the cap and pointed the thing at them - to their manifest alarm - for they hurriedly motioned to put it back eafely in its case. Thcn\ they fell upon a stout little brnket J was carrying, filled with my various bottles - drew all of them out, and came unon a big bottle of glycerine which they turned over and over, and as it looked like something good to drink, I was in hopes they would try it. I would gladly have sacrificed a cherished bottle of glycerine for the pleasure of seeing them choking over it. The English nave recently built a fine railway from Gibraltar to Cordova cdanecting with the other Spanish lines - thus releasing Gibraltar from her isolated position. He had a comfortable ride to Cordova - through generally dreary, vast, waste country, except for the olive orchards. We were almost an hour late, and our train from Seville, in the wagon lit of which we had 2 compartments engaged, was already in.

It seems a great atretch of time since T last wrote anything, and the days hare been inexpressibly long and tiresome. The cold that I bdgan to take in the chill Madrid gallery grew worse and worse, and I am still in its clutehss. ffs stnysd three days at Cranada - and it rained more or less all the time - it was not cold, except in the house and in our dreary little sitting room, overhung by the weeping and dripping trees, with the perpetual sound of a little splashing fountain below, it was too gloomy to be brightened by the tiny stove, that only smoked and never burned - our bedrooms were very damp, tfe left
for Wbraltar on Sunday, Dec.	on V e 5 o'clock train, which made

it necessary to he called at a quarter to 4, in order to dress, breakfast, and drive the long distance to the station. Theodore and Hr. lAneley breakfasted down stairs - but Vettie and I took our wretched little meal of bad coffee, bad eggs and butter in our melancholy sitting

Then we went out to the pier which extends some distance - afld found that some of it was quite covered with water - the wa was breaking from time to time over it. Our little ■teamed 4*^ some distance out, bobbing up and down on the rough water, and there were 2 small boats to take up and our lu< gage out. So we
waded in' some places ankle deep in water, and then we plumped into the

A very quiet and uneventful week at Luxor. I tried to ride over to Kamac the first afternoon * and spent the morning of the 2d day in Luxar*. principally at uohammed Lohassib’s * and in the afternoon went over to tho races - and between them all, grew so tired and added so aueh to ay cold - that. X have stayed on the boat every day since * except Sunday,- when Nettie and I went over to the little English chapel for servise. We found 4 dahabeahs at Luxor - and they were arriving from down the river during the week. 1 believe we left 11 lying there. Two days before we came away, we pulled across the river to below the German's new saotle. There has been no wind for days - we intended getting away yesterday - but there was not a breath - so when after breakfast this morning a fair little wind sprang up, Theodore gave orders to start, but it soon failed - and we had to take to tracking.

They wore all in a perfect rage - and it was all that Nettie and 1 and Jones could do, to keep then quiet enough to wash and dress their wounds. Yhen we had landed and the officers had come on board we had a solemn hearing, except when the excitement of tho old Reis broke out. A huge audience on the bank - the broken heads were exhibited, and a man came on the lower deck from the crowd, to shew a broken head of his own.

~Xn epite of a very strong north head wind, we made this place at 5 o'clock in the afternoon - but were obliged to tie up on the eppa-site side of the river, because of the wind - it has been banging and knocking US about in the most pronounced manner T have ever known on the river. The Teis was close behind us - and most of her people, as well as Theodore and Nettie, crossed in the felucca to the little new house at the El fab landing, which we had noticed on our way up, and which we were sure was occupied by Mr, Tylor, or Mr. Somers-Clarke. They found
the latter there, busy with his excavations - and wearing the native
/
dress. We will go over tomorrow early, »nd make him a visit, and see the temple that he discovered, and is now excavating. The north wind still raging - but much cooler.
V# pulled iiron the river early this morning end directly after brockfeet vent up to see Mr. Somers-^larke, whom we found with bis workmen, busy at his excavations. He is beginning to lay bare the reMine ef a temple within the great inclosing walls of the ancient fortress. These walls are built of mud bricks, and are of extraordinary thickness, -	37 ft. wide, and of course are very ruinous - as the
anslsnt city is supposed to have existed under the Old Empire. Ur. Sewers-Clarks discovered the site of the temple, which was not known, and has made'*several trencher, which reveal certain limits, and the two entrance portals - and the lines of walls. It would seem to be in a great mix - that is newer buildings had been placed on the site of elder Cnee - and the old materials used for the new. Thus car-touches^ of Thotmes II and III - with the good bas relief wort and painting Of that period, are found with the much poorer work of much more recent perlode. Fragments of columns - and bases of painted and earned columns were eeen - and ruined and mutilated statues. The infiltration of lile water, wi th its decampoeing salts has made the stones almost into powder, and the work has to be very carefully and slowly done. He had 12 workmen. He afterwards took us t* his house, where he showed us the plans of the temple so far as ha had been able to trace them. It was moot interesting. He had h«d a mud house built in which he lives, and Indeed it is still building - that is quite a large vaulted room, which is to serve an dining and living room is being completed. He has one room for himeelf. another for his colleague, and a little court with
kitch.ft **	tor	hi.	5? ».». His own room had moroly plastered
«
wall*, and a sand floor spread upon a bate of finely broken poteherde which form an excellent drainage - and as he wears the native dross, with no stockings, and the big red native shoes, which he kicks off as
soon ae he enters his house, and the sand is pleasant enough - then
nEjlSr
when he wapte a new carpet as he said, the sand is all swept out, and fresh sand.brought in. His bed, working table, shelves for books etc were rather primitive, but he said ho found it comfortable. It was
- '•8 X	'• «- 'T-fl	t
quite a revelation to eee him in the native dress - he used always to
Vx £ -tBpIF'-	It. fiW	+
be so faeti4iously dressed in white flannels and gaiters. He always ",r*	which	now	look so incongruous . He wears the complete
drees - tarboosh, turban., white vest, and blue cotton dress. He finds
"■ *s *t s r t ® ■
it most oemfortable he oaye - and the only tolerable thing for his work, that it all goes into the wash tub every day. The dust that excavating makes would be greatly trying to an European dress. ve were greatly entertained with him, his work and manner of living. He walked down
to the dahabeah with us and sat wwhile. All the men were amased to

W. Naville under the auspices of tho Egypt Exploration Fund, has accomplished marvelouo things - and still has an array of work neople digging at the lower torraeas, and at the accumulated rubbish of centuries that liss beneath tho temple. A long colonnade resting against the cliff has been laid bare - and the northern and southern colonnades at right angles to this, with accompanying chapels and rooms, with brilliant paintings and carvings - though these do not compare with tho fineness and beauty of the decorations of the terrace above built by Queen Hat-

Monday. Feb. 25.
X rode into the town thie morning, while Theodore, Kettle and Dy. fare walked to Mohammed Mohassibs - where we spent an hour or two talking to the old man and looking at hie things. Theodore bought two or three pretty things - Vohassib presented ue all with parting souvenirs - and we said a prolonged and quite an affectionate goodbye. Before vo started on our walk this morning we had the two little arab sisters, who when we were in Luxor on our way up, moored at the genireh on the other side of the river, used to some every day with their father, who

water, with the graoe and natural abandonment ef a young animal - and I told Sella te tell the father to go oyer to Luxor and buy each of then a drees and a pair of drawers, and I would pay for them. So the day after they came immensely proud and grateful to show their new dot bee - a dark blue cotton drees, with an undergarment, and n thin beflewered blue doth veil - in all of which they were not half so pic* tureeque but waoh more comfortable. After we had bean in Luxor this time four Or fire days, they discovered us, and appeared - their new dethbe very much toned dawn by dirt and use. T gave the elder child a flannel under shirt of mine, that was so shrunken T could not wear it, and ehe Immediately retired into the depths of the wheat field at the top of the bank, and put it on, in all this unbearable heat - and although the never had worn anything so thick and warm, she persisted in keeping it on. We had them on deck - to their great delight - and gave them some oranges and sweats to carry away With them - the older girl was remarkably oretty - with oerfact teeth, and the sweetest smile and her delight in everything she saw, was touching. She netted the rugs on which she sat, garing about and saying softly to herself quiss -qulss (pretty).

t^ursday. March 7.
A north wind all day - but we have managed to make r/b miles -massing the big Aboufoyaah chain, tfe overtook the Isis early in the day - and were also in company with the London, a dahabeah whose people

closed mad<*hro#a##la hor canvass coverings. Lato this afternoon as we sat on dock, aha being wary oloto to us, wo hoard shouts proceeding from ^working haat that was coming up the river - and ooao oxcitad talk between the two craws - an the working boat was a dragoman, with servant^ who (aa wa learned)called out to the Rais of the London, that aha waa wantedby a gefctleman to go to Assouan, that he would arrive by train tomorrow, and that ha (the Dragoman) had orders to engage her for two man the* They at once put up their oars - and unfurled their sails - and made far the shore, where the Dragoman was landing. It was eueh a sudden and unexpected change for the men - and they were so delighted with another engagement of 2 months - for at this time of the year they are generally falling our of work. There were many congratulation called out to them from our boat. This morning as ths Postal Steaner Hatasou passed us quite close, we saw hr. Lapsley who was waving to us,4and staring at us through his glasses. We are within two or three miles ef Haji Kandeel - the station for Tel el-Amama - which we intend visiting tomorrow.
Friday. March 8th.
A heavy north wind blowing all the morning. Tn the afternoon floating and rowing we reached Haji Kandeel about 4 o’clock. A very noisy unpromising crowd of natives gathered on the shore - and such e vociferation went on, T wa- forced +o com** below, tc get away from
them.

Saturday. March 9th.
-Wb day dawnod very gray and cold - high vind - having taken cold a day or two ago, X wisely decided to stay in the boat. A still more noisy, rude and vociferous crowd, with their donkeys about the boat, and the choice of the latter was not difficult, when all were so poor and Jaded. They oame back about 11 o'clock having seen part of the grottoes or tombs - and bery tired of their poor donkeys. The guides did not know anything about the grottoes - and instead of going to the North, which are the best, and seeing the tomb of Amen-ophis XV or Khuenaten, they had only gone to the south - anc missed tho root. Nettie's donkey fell with her, and gave her quite a shock, tfe came a* ay from that noisy shore at once, but the north wind was so strong, that after struggling against it for half an hour, we took refuge at the end of a sand bank, opposite and a little way below, the Isis, and anchored strongly - the water rushing in real waves past us -and the sand flying furiously an\ here we are ! or the night I suppose -as, although there Ss a full moon - there is little proepect of the wind dying out.

v Ve have peeved many an uncomfortable hour einoe I lavt made an eVtfy in thie Journal. Ve get oft from Alexandria the morning after but »oon after mailing loet one of the sailors overboard, who fortunate* ly wee able t# swim and got en to a buoy - a small boat with 6 men wee •ent oat to him in the heavy sea, and was caps!ted - and had it not beon fer 2 pilot beats in the neighborhood, who went to their assistance, all the f seuld have been loot. It vae more than 3 hours before we got them on beard, during which time we lay at anchor, tonoing and rolling. The Singapore proved to be very slow, very dirty - badly officered -bad food • and a noisy lot of Germane and Italians - and I thought tho days and particularly, the nights would never end. On the first of April we arrived at Messina, where we stayed 12 hours, tfe went ashore and drove about the rather uninteresting Italian town - th* duet and wind being the principal factors. The next morning we were at Naples, where the boat was to stay *0 hours * and we delightfully mads preparations to spend the day and night on shore. We drove to the brand Hotel, which
•ad wn obliged tt go up to the i/Mt K»4 wh.r.»»g*t »*ry pl.a.ant roomo. But the weather was oold, wind high* and a thiok atmosphere • and Vesuvius quito invisible. 1 wasnot.well daring the night, and the noxt morning whon Jones appeared from the	amfins iht would not leave until sometime in the
nigbt, mad would take 24 hears to Leghorn, where we had expected to leave her, we held solemn council and decided to go directly by rail to Fleregge* So Jones was sent back to the boat to pack and bring away our..trunks, and Theodore wont off to secure a compartment in the night train to Romo, and the Dr. was sent for to |«q me and say if I was fit to start, and the upshot of the whole thing was, that ws had a very cemfortable night on the train arriving in Home at 6:30 A.k.
Oo drove to the Quirinal Hotel oo short a distance off, and had a good wash, followed by a delicious breakfast in the restaurant, and were off te Florence at 8:30 - reaching here nt 2:30. The town is very, very full • and we had seme difficulty about the number of our rooms - but are mew {uite pleasantly settled. Yesterday morning Theodore, Wary and 1 went to the Uffizsl - Tattle not bein^ well enough to go with us. Dr. Baldwin and hr. Berenson came to tea yesterday in the afternoon -and directly after lunch today Theodore, kary and I drove to fiesole, and out over the kits. Theodore went off by himself this morning to the Mtti - Umry to church - end I stayed home with Tettie, who though better is still weak » but there is now no danger of any fever, as we feared at first there night be.

afternoon Ur* Berenson took us to *ee the new doticelli which has late-

v
in the antiehamber, noticed high up in a dark comer & picture which he thought in the Botticelli style and knowing that a certain painting of his known onoe to have existed was now lost, he vent to the director of the Uuseusa and told him what he had seen^ The result was that the picture was removed to one of the privato rooms of the Uffizzi - and

Today Nettie went out in the morning for a drive, and then again in the afternoon to San Miniato, and went into the ehurch for a few minutes.

We left Florence on Thursday morning sobn after breakfast in two lcndauo - sending .Tone* with the heavy luggage by train - and stopping two hours during the middla of the day for rest and lunch - reached Sienna by 6:20 - the distance being 40 miles. It was an enchanting drive - the day was oerfact - the roads likewise - leading over the hills and down the hills, and along the valleys - the country very hilly, with strange abruot little hills, almost every one crowned with a walled town, or a convent, or a fortress. Olive orchards and vine-

Our hotel, the Grand Hotel Royal do Solanot was an old palace -and stands high above the valley with beautiful views, and our lofty rooms open on to a stone parapet overlooking the neighborhood to the west - Nettle is again not well - and I havo boon staying at horns with her all day - she got too tired I fsar tho ethor day on her drive here. Yesterday we sallied out early under Sorenson's leadership, and walked about the town, visiting the Palailt Publico, the great town hall, built in the latter part of the 11th century* Close tc it rises ths slender campanile called Del Man-gia * it stands in the square now called Vittorio Kmanuele, and used to be the Piazza del Campo - >t is strangely semicircular in form, and rising liks an amphitheatre. Dante, in his Purgatorio speaks of this elasza* The interior ie very interesting - with frescoes of the Siennas# masters - a large one of the Virgin and child, with a canopy borne by saints, and opposite an equestrian portrait of a martial figure of Fogliani de Ricci - by Simone Martini. In the Sala dei Hove, art frescoes by Ambaoftlo Lorenzettl painted in 1337-39 - much
quaint and interesting. Tfr#p we mat to
the

is built in aouraao ef whits and black marble, which at first give a wary bisarre effect - but the infinite variety of detail, and the richness ef the marbles make the interior very interesting. The pavement too is remarkably rich in graffiti - though much of it is covered with beards and cannot be seen.
We spent most of the morning at the Duomo, listening to a high mass * music net very good, but the vhold scene was impressive, ihen ms all became quite fro sen we came iway. It has been raining a little all day - and X have been indoors all the afternoon. At sunset last evening, Theodore, Mary and I walked to the fortress as it is called, er the "lAssa” a beautiful promenade with fine trees and shrubberies ep ths site dfa former fortress built by Charles v, - giving charming vieva from its height over plain and mountains.

coning out these deadly cold galleries, the bright eun was quite blinding - end to put sene warmth into us, we walked through the streets down to the old and picturesque Roman Gate, on its Massive fitrussan

By the tine we had climbed the stony street and reached our hotel 1 was almost dsad with fatigue. Today the morning dawned dark and threat-ening, and it has gone on from bad to worse. «Ve have all stayed indoors writing and grumbling. Among other letters Theodore wrote was one to Evermrd Fielding, which was taken out with others into the hall and laid on the porters desk. Soton afterwards Basil Fielding came along, and sssing the letter addressed to his brother, went to the register to sss who was likely to have written it - and seeing our names, sent in his card. <Ve were delighted to see the pleasant boy again, and persuaded him and his friend, a priest, Father Forbes, to have lunch with us - and after a jolly lunch, and visit they went out with Berenson to see some sights. They had corae from Assisi this morning, and went back this afternoon - they aro spending their Master vacation at Assisi - and as we intend driving over there tomorrow (only
8 miles) we have arranged to meet and lunch together. basil is still

On our way home Mr. Sorenson took us to the Ban Vitale church to show us a beautiful Franeia - an altar pi see - two angels with a lovely lanaitcape. ti% should have left Bologna at 6 o'clock • but on reaching the station heard that our train was 40 minutes late - but tbe waiting was very amusing - for a number of ehhreh dignitaries were waiting for an incoming train which me to bring an eminence ef Cardinal Archibiehop, with numerous clerical belongings to attend an important meeting. He proved an emiable looking old man -and was most respectfully greeted by the crowd. We were late getting
r.
here - and were disappointed not to get our old rooms - the hotel is crowded - and eo are th^ trains with tourists coming north - by the time our luggage arrived and we had our supper, it was not far from one o'clock* Ifoio morning we started out soon after breakfast for tho Poldi Possoli, and spent an hour or more - then to the Wabroslana -and homo by one o'clock tired indeed.

and ten saints - Mr. berenson ordered down all the altar decorations so that we might better see the nfeture - and vs stayed in the deadly cold little church, uhtil we w^re nitrified, looking «t the delicious picture. In Berenson’s recent book on Lotto, which «e have not yet seen, he reproduces the principal Lottos - so that I won’t try any description of these lovely nictures myeelf, but will better refresh

UuMtm. and whe ie the owner of many good pictures, not only to ehow time to us, but to take us to the palace of the Koroni family, and to'show us two or three other plaoee - so that soon after lunoh we again peeked ourselves into the carriage or rather into 2, and drove to the Maisee Plehinelli, a most charming house with superb grounds in gsod order, #e were received most hospitably and talked our little French end Italian as belt we could - and then Signor P. went with us to the Uoroni palace, a magnificent house in the highest pact of the old town - where in a splendid ioftly room we saw two of the most splendid koroni's - which have never been photographed. One of a young man in a lovely harmony of red - and the other \ most distinguished middle aged man in black, against a gray background - tho nose, character, colour, quite perfect. tfhile we were looking ut these, the Countess l.oroni arrived, a charming little person, who did the honours of her house most graoiously - and took us from on© pretty room to another, filled with pictures and bric-a-brac. After that 7© went to the ftoucardi palace,

callant aollactlon of pictures etc. - an especially beautiful Cariani, and seme Guardis - the rain poured all the afternoon and evening* ■ This morning ve went to the famous Bergamo Gallery - a small gallery - but of exquisite quality - what treasures - and what a pleasure! The morning was beautifully clear and for the first time ve saw the wide ▼lew from the upper town - we took a drive around the cantle and were home in time for a hurried lunch, and off for the station, where we had to say a reluctant goodbye to Derenson, who had to go to Vgniee to Join Mrs* Jack Gardiner for a day or two* Ve got back to kilan at 2:30 and Nettie,Mary and I drove from the station to the Brera , where Theodore afterwards joined us - and afterwards he and 1 went to the private house where he had seen two little Dutch pictures for sale, and after having another look at them decided to telegraph Lerenson to buy them for him. Ve are all ready for our journey to Lucerne tomorrow.

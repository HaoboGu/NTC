required, as he has the contract with Government to carry troops - but it seems that was an exaggeration. They go by rail to Nag Hamadi, and then are ehipped.

About 10 o'olock we deaeriad a Cate Steauar awidaatly stuck on the sand, ahead of us - and on coning up with bar found bar to toft the ammartis, which passed us yesterday. She was surrounded by gyassea, who were relieving her of sons of her luggage* Mot long after
we passed the Steamer Shellal, a complete wreck, and partly submerged.

She wae deserted and in the hands of the wreckers - hawing sttwft a holft
in her bottom on some unsuspected stones in the river. Half an hour
■tf
after while sitting at luncheon, our boat gave a sudden lurch, and there was a grinding of stones under her bow. We all rushed on forward dftek,
\ some real cal^Jty; but examination showed no leak, and we
camp on our way rejoicing; but it was rather nervous wark for awhile.
/
next we saw one or the large tinge steamers, empty, ami abandoned, and
y
left tied to the bank, to wait for higher water, so that sh> could get down the river. Then we came upon the /unnartis, who had got off the sand, and passed us \ short time before, transferring her passengers to the Tewfik, who van sending her to the Ammartis - the latter draw-
ing less water. So when we found ourselves tonight 6 miles below v?aeta and having made 37 miles, and only touched sand once for a aftmnt, we congratulated ourselves. A beautiful day and evening.

We left Lucerne yesterday at 7:30 A.M. in clouds and rain, which continued all day * and arrived here at 6 o'clock. Came to our eld quarters - most homelike - with the smiling familiar faces of the Concierge and his wife - feknil the waiter, and the kind, deprecating femme de chambre - news of the successful battle at Manilla, and the triumph of Commodore Dewey. Poor Spain - I am full of sympathy for the bravo Queen Christina who has done all she could to rule and direct the troublesome country. Today it has been storaing violently, with burets of alternate sunshine. Lary and I wore settling ourselves this

morning - and began with gowns and shopping this afternoon. She has

gone to the Circus with Theodore and Ponty this evening - and I am
kiinint our cheerful salon company, with a bright wood fire.

Just one week ago tonight I mado the last entry - and it is hard to realise - and now we are here again, after a very comfortable and monotonous voyage. The Kaieer tfilheln der Grosse is the finest ship I have ever sailed on. Such comfort, luxury, cleanliness - good service, and the best and most profuse table I ever saw. Pr. Rathbone and Fielding were at the station to say goodbye, the morning we left London. A quick and pleasant ride to Southampton, and as we ran along the big dock, with the Kaiser lying close to it, she looked enormous from the train. On three consecutive days we made 560 miles - and the voyage would have made a record, had we not 2 days before reaching

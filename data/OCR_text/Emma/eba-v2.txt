Se laid at our resting place of lat t night near Ooloeeaneh until about 11 e9eleok - waiting for a breexe. A delicious morning -air freeh and sun bright - we went ashore after breakfeet and walked up and down on the hard level black mud. The usual Egyptian village of mud houses embowered in palm treee was near us, and over the stretch of freshly ploughed ground that lay between, and into which, men were busy transplanting onions, a thinr I had never seen done, came a string of children and fellaheen to stare at us* and to lie in wait for possible oacksheesh. The first one I met, was a little mother, looking hardly more than a child herself, with a really tweet, clean baby - almost naked - indeed its only dress was a spare corner of ite mother’s garment, such a very little red bronxy baby it was, with perfectly rounded plump legs and feet - its little round brown head covered vith the blackest hair, and ite sleepy eyes when it opened them, as big and eoftly black

Then to the greatest of all, that of Set! 1st or Belzoni’s tomb, who discovered it.

The day wae hot and notionless. We had a big awning upt and after lunch I had my little writing table carried on deck and wrote letters. A perfectly golden sunset - not a speck of n cloud anywhere, and not the stir of the faintest ripple on the golden water.

ropes - wading, swimming and with almost no clothing. They fastened

the ropes to various rooks and began to pull us ahead* There had been
a tremendous hubbub from the first - so much so that the wonder was
\
that any order oould be heard and understood - but now, the turmoil increased - all the captains shouted to each oth«r, and to all the men -
and all the men yelled to the Captains and to each other - they bellowed,
they gesticulated, they roared - there was a difference of opinion between one of the helmsmen and the Sheik - the latter ran from his place
at the top of one of the esmpanionways back to the helm, and snatched it from the steersman - in the meantime we saw that our bow wras rapidly approaching a jagged ooint of rock, and Theodore sprang up with a warn-

making a rapid sketch of the hole on the leaf of his pocket book, shewed Theodore a plan for mending it, which 1 declared perfectly feasible. All the whils the Bedouins were shouting and prancing about in the wa-ter, until they understood what the damage was, when uttor consternation

Of course we were in a rage of disappointment - at least Theodore, Mettle and I were - I don't think I ever felt oo wicko4, and during the root of the day ve three moped scout hardly speaking. Nettie and I clambered un on eons rocke, amongst some little acsela bushes, and sat down almost woeping. Mrs. Davis and Howard however, had wielbly brightened under the whole thing - for they had cherished I am euro many eaoret dreads and fears of danger and dervishes, to say nothing of the monotonous life on the dahaboah . But there was certainly a charm in our unusual situation in that waste of waters, and as the afternoon waned, and the yellow cliffs cane out in pink tints, and the shores began to darkbn into violet and purple, the silence was only broken by the rush of the rapids, and all night whenever I wakened there was the sold fresh air, and the noothUng noise of rushing - and T could hardly sloop for enjoyment of it. And so this morning we slipped quietly and ignoctinously back to Elephantine, and when we sat down to

Two or thdare quiet hours on dock alone, under the awnings in tho afternoon light, amongst these beautiful surroundings, is something to enjoy, Theodore ha* Bade all the preparation! for going to Wady Haifa in the little steamer Sesmeh* which leaves Bhellal next Monday, and makes the trip there and back in a week.

Another day at lovely Philee - rode over and found it ex-oo eoiroly warm. Toaant one waiting: for me; he had told Ur*. Newman that Wit "Sitt* wae toning from Assouan today. There was another little follow I had never before seen. The most delicious little oarago "Dohdowah", not much bigger than his name, but so solid and oquaro, with ouch big cheaks, and very big soft eyes - he was too delightful*' Ho attached himself to Howard Aaory, and reaehod just about .to hie knee. Like Yemma, he carried a fly whisk, and kept thw flies off hie chosen patron with gre^t solemnity. Such composure and self reliance I hare rtmver soon in a small person before. There are a few families living over on the small and Interesting island of Biggeh opposite Philae, and their little mud houses are clustered a-bout wfcfct remains of a small temple. The Newrans heve them under tbeir special '"'protection it would seem - and these little people come from there, end pass bnckwsrds end forwards between it and Philae, quite independent of boats by rolling up their single little cotton garment on^ their heads and swimming across.

whleh are largo rowboatc with comfortable cushioned seats, and a sail,

and S0*o do son men to row, and wont back as far as the big cataract, whihh oo*o Of the Bedouins swin down for tho pleasure of the tburlsts, and a small bakohooeh. I had eeon the thing before, and did not injoy the eight of tho shivering, dripping men as they came out of the water well enough to wish to see it again. So the rest went off leaving mo with 0*0 boatman.	It wa9 a delicious half hour - the waning light
of tho afternoon - the quiet, broken only by the rushing water, that strange scenery and wide desolation. As soon as the others got out of sight, my boatman got out, washed himself- spread his outer cotton dress bn the sand, and began his devotions. It was a sight much better worth the seeing than the one the others had gone to see. One can never say too much ok think, or see too much of this wonderful rock scenery of the Cataract, such strange polished and rounded rocks, worn by the action of water into such fantastic shapes, the water having left a black deposit of iron on them, so that they look like mammoth castings «* and theik theee ancient hieroglyphs on the still more ancient

There were many of Cooks tourists in the train, for ?. etennere beside our own were going - and after that short brotherhood were very glad we were ic be by ourselves, be lay at the bank sometime getting in our stores, ana had time to examine our quartern and settle oursfslves. It was not very encouraging though everything was clean. Our staterooms open on ths outside deck.

All the afternoon I was on the little deck outside my room, with my opera glaoo and book • enjoying the beautiful stretches of the river, so unlike the lower Nile - the villages not so frequent, but of better type - many of the houses with arched roofs, and some of them looking almost like forts, with large enclosing outside walla for protection ; passed some splendid sycamores - the true Plantanms Occidental!#, being a native of Egypt.

Passenger* of the Gonaa. stopped hare to visit the temple, but having ntopped ourselves to take on the manager, we kejxt on, preferring to give our time more lei* surely-to the bert thing9. It seems these 3 boats are run with but one dragoman, and a person they call the Manager, whose head quarters are on our boat. Yesterday, we had no one on board speaking English but the Engineer, whp is English - and the 3 young Arab servants are particularly helpless and Ineffective; so we were very glad to have this manager, who speaks English almost perfectly. He ie a Syrian by birth, with an English mother - and is most attentive to us. The desert now comes down almost to the river on both sides - and we wonder what the
poor people live on in thin part of r'ubia.

We pass Sabftrah at lunch tims, and tush out to sso it, lying shrowdsd in a gol-dsn send drift - with only the pylons to be seen, two sphynxes, and two Statues Of Eeaesos II standing before them; who built this temple and dedicated it to Anson and Ftah. It is on the walls of ths court of this temple, that a procession of the children of Rameses II appear - each with his name. If this list is correct, this great Rameees must have been quite the father of a family, for it accords him 111 sons and 67 daughtersJ This temple is worth seeing, but ws are going to stop to do that when we come down. The afternoon was very warm and still - and we eat on the ll£$le upper deck, delighted with the beautiful scenery. Occasionally great rocky dotached peaks rising from the desert, and desert desolatien everywhere. We reached Korosko about 5 o'clock. Korosko has always seemed to me for som3 reason very interesting and African, and at the very verge of civilization. I suppose because I have read of

the of fleer®' quarter® very attractive - and 1 was quite touched by a little carefully tended flower garden, with familiar European and English flower® in it, looking very dejected and homesick 1 must say.

We climbed around the steep bank, and a-cross the foot of the great drift of golden sand, which has blown aoross the desert behind the mountain, and overflowed in one enormous sheer unbroken line almost to the waters edge - quite cutting off one corner of the faoade. They are truly stupendous things these Colossi, and the longer I sat and looked at them, the more fascinating thsy grow. #s stayed a long time staring up «t them from wvsry angle, and a still

Last night ths thnmsnster went down to 44°. Since the last dervish raids, tourists are not allowed as formerly to go ou* several miles beyond the fort, to see the 2d cataract from the top of abousir. 1 should like to have seen It, and especially looked down the road, along which poor, brass, deluded Gordon stalled on hie way to Khartoum, we spent the rest of the morning until 11 o'clock wandering about ano looking over tfodehouse dacha’s queer boat - then started at 11 o’clock - and reached Abu Sim-

We got away at 5:30, straining our eyes to the last moment tosses those great smiling faces - wo arc now 9:30 at Ibrin, having made 80 miles today.

me as this temple of tho groat Hataou - or Hatohopsu* as it is getting to oa tha fashiaa to call her. The spot chosen for it is so unique - in a cul-de-eae of tha grsat yellow cliffs* which tower sheer above it in fan* tastio fom until they meet the blue sky. The inagination supplies the aagalfieeat approval that once led to it from the river* across the plain and up t# Its lavsl in a series of terraces - with its obelisks and avenues of aphynxes.	Ilia sculptured paintings on what is left of this
temple are so beautiful and curious* that one never tires of looking at than. til the weary* never ending kings offering to Gods - all the array of Isloes* Horuses* Khnums, Khonsus* Anubisss* and the like* give plaee to oheerful portrayal of life and its occupations - and the minute history of Hatehepeut's famous expedition to the land of Punt* and its return. Tha thins laden with spoil • the processions with strange aniaals and foreign trees and shrubs, nre charmingly tainted. One of the greet,features of the place* is the wonderful view from the upper
tsrrua*t A#*kigg Mm that nUty if desert desolation, te the radiantly Kr**n	*	to the rivor, with the houses of Luxer on tom opposite

The tsmplee of Gumeh end the fteeeeeue were not then built, but they ere In eweh utter ruin thnt they do net new form special features in the plain from this height* The temple of taenophis III before which etood the Celoeei was net in existence, and not a vestige of it remains, though the Colossi still eit in battered existence - neither was > edinet Habou built - but over in Thebes the great Karnao was standing though not as ws know it with the gigantie hall of columns of Set! let, but the older tesipl# of the Thotae* etood, with Hatshopsu'e eplondid obelisks, almost in a line with her temple here at Der sl-3ahari - what a splendour it must hare been! There is great excavating going on here, under V. Narille - and we cane away half blinded and choked by the dust which the army of excavators were making - and 1 had my last favorite gallop across the green fragrant plain, and we irrived at home very hot and tired and glad to esoape from the noisy donkey boys and the clamours for baksheesh into the cool quiet dahabsah, where tea was waiting, ind the friendly samovar steaming its welcome. '"he temple of Luxor has been tremendously excavated, and is now most imposing and interesting - and the forest of papyrus columns which I have always thbught one of the most beautiful sights of the river, has nov been laid bare, to the bases of the columns. The great colonnade ^hich wa3 even more buried, has also
been entirely cleared, and adds immensely to ths sffsct from the river. They are still very busy with the Rameses II end - hare cleared away a great many nail we houses , and laid entirely bare one of the pylons and the sitting Colossus - down upon which you look from the height of the street opposite. The mosque still stands on the untouched ground, but
that will soon be remowed and the other pylon and colossus laid bare,
* /
the head of which new only shows. This work in Upper Egypt is all being conducted by the Ohiseh Museum, and is of immense value. Here at Luxor there are eewaral lines of little tramways, with iron dumping care, which dump the earth over the river bank, adding much to its improvement. We were at the temple yesterday just as all the men stopped work for the noon root. What a busy hive it was! Mohammed's friend and patron, the well known Russian U. Goliniescheff was at Luxor with hie beautiful boat the 2et-el-Nil ( Spirit of the Nile). He bought her two or three yearo ago, and has spent, so Mohammed says over £2000 on her eince. U. Goliniescheff had invited Theodors to come and see her, and one morning as we were in our felucca, Theodore and I, stopped to make a visit. She was charmingly fitted up. The next day V. Gol-inieoeheff returned the visit, bringing with him some photographs, he had made of his boat. They have our old Reis Achmet, and some of our sailors. We had light north wind, or no wind during our four days at Luxor - and in spite of north wind today, we have made a fine run of 44-l/2 miles, and are now atKsneh, and will see Denderah tomorrow, which is just across the river.

tfe stayed all day in Assiout yesterday. I went into the baiaar with then all. and found it very warm and the eun tremendously brightf so that after going to the telegraph and P«0.

In the afternoon I stayed at hone, and not having tha courage to face the blaze and heat again, the rest rede out through the town to the mountain to see the tombs, which are not interesting - the view however is superb, ale started early this noming, but tha wind was so violent ws tied up under tha shelter of a high bank for 4 hours - and the awnings were

dore (art the men the ueual sheep at Aeeiout, and we brought a nice fat little fallow along in the email boat. I was pleased to see him released frlm captivity as we dlrew up, and when I was called below to luncheon,
I left hjm merrily nibbling at the herbage on the bank - I went on deck again immediately after luncheon and to my horror saw his brown hide stretohed to dry almost on the identical spot where I left him cropping the grass - and his body hanging at the cook's larder. What an example of the transitoriness of life! We moved away late this afternoon, after the wind lulled, and had got well out into the stream, when it fas die* covered that we had left one of our sailors behind us - and sending the small boat,Off, he was found asleep in the young wheat. We are now about 10 o*oloek anchored in the stream opposite L'anfaloot thus making 26 miles. The moon was eo bright tho non were able to row later. I have just finished reading Peter Ibbotson for the second time. The first time I read it, I was so touohed and enamoured with it, that I thought I might have overrated ii - but there is the same charm about it - which though rather difficult to put into words, is none the less potent. It is a venturs to attempt explanation of the mystery of the other life, and of the heart breaking separation that divides one loving soul from another at death. Thnt he touches upon truthful possibilities and that if we cultivated our spiritual Instincts more assiduously we might bridge over some of the dark placet that divide the natural and spiritual, I think no ons will deny'.

try. As the morning won on, the wind grew very cold, and drew out straight ahead, and after drifting about some time, we tied up near a pretty spot, where was a kind of cottage now deserted, and what had been
a fine garden. After lunch we went up the bank , and walked about the garden, which was filled with young orange and ienon trees -and a great many pomegra&ites, now just coming into their new red and green foliage.

W« found iMl superb thistles, with beautiful variegated leaves, making a very deeoratlve plant - and alt of Mall chicory flowed - quite like oure9 but smaller and of a more branching habit. And Hassan found a green Mantis insectf which Jones took home. The air has been delicieus today - so cool and grateful and fragrant. fls have made today about 25 miles - and are now lying below some lofty pines, within a few miles of Bedrasheyn, which we will reach tomorrow. The wind is at last quiet -and the night serene..
lurch 15th.
Arrived at Bedrasheyn this morning early, making 10 miles -and directly after breakfast, started out to S’emphir and r>akkarah. A more perfect day could not have been imagined - cool and a trifle cloudy it was quits psrfect. rive years ago, on just such another morning I took that same charming ride - through the pleasant palm groves, and past ths mud villages and across the fields, with their fragrant blossoming crops, and herds of cAttle and sheep in their little camps, made by cut-ting down ths crop for a space, and leaving the rest as enclosing walls. Then again into the palms, where lie the*two colossal recumbent figures of Haneses II, and where we stopped to see ^hat was not to be seen when we were here before, the excavations of the famous temple of Ptah, which has been lying for centuries under a magnificent grove of palms - it was curious to see the trees left in a huge ball of earth, perhaps for transplanting, and the ruined v/alls, columns, broken statues etc. -lying down below. ""he bases of the columns which are in nlace, are
truly nlMMl, usd th. o wrings and inscriptions on that, and OB the eallW^sars in beautiful style. We reached Marietta’s houee just in \
tine for lunch, which «« had taken with us, and found two parties already lunching them. One of them was the Russian Prince Soltykoff with hie dra£***ft, * crowd of servants - silver service - easy chairs- embroidered coverings, and 1 don’t know what all. His dragoman told Saleh that he had quarelled with his pretty wife, and sent her back to Paris* He leeked most lonely, a weak young fellow, and had a hollow cough. WO Sulked about, and sat down on that Ion; wide, covered verandah waiting for our lunoh to bo ready - end saw the departure of the English party, the arrival of a German group - and the getting under way of two or three camels, laden with the elaborate Soltykoff equipage - then after we had lunched, went to the Sera pa urn, and to the tomb of Ti, which is much better seen than formerly - a new roof now covers it, and a sky light which oeems incongruous - hut it affords protection, and enables one to see the fseeinating interior, it is a beautiful work of the Ancient Empire* We lingered about in the desert, and rode leisurely home, in as roundabout a way ae we could - for it was all so charming - earth, air, sky - and we felt it was our last expedition. tfe are lying in a beauti-ful spot - with the palms near us, with their fascinating perspectives, an English dahabeah near us. We intend crossing the river tomorrow for a day at Helouan.

I have passed the first dull day I ever had in Egypt:	We	went
over t#sHplsunn $111# WOdig well known and much froquontod health nitri, with swlphmrgbathe, lying in the desert. A dreary, ghaatly

tree* and nfcltlhe m believing the pure desert air contaminated by them.

lie lunehed at the Khedival Hotel - a modern large, luxurious hotel, much superior in its fittings and arrangements to Shepheards. There were a let ef English people there - hr. Fielding found some people he knew - and we were all glad to eoae sway, and roach home, fooling tho day had been quite wasted . I should so much rather have stayed -and wandered through the palms an 1 enyoyed Bedrasheyn.

The faet of Ramadan was ushered in lest night by the firing of many guns from the Citadel - and all ; ood Mohammedans now will neither •at er smoke until the evening gun tomorrow releases them from their fast, until ths rising of the sun on the following morning. The effect of this fasting is said to bo none of the best - as shewn in irritability and sickness - excessive nightly feasting, following the day of fasting. Theodore, Nettie and T went to the ^useum this noming, the rest driving into ohurch - but we found the Vuseua closed, and learned that from today, it will only open in the afternoons - so ws divided our time between the garden and driving, went back in the afternoon and spent all of it there. Tonight as the sunset pttn was fired ffom the citadel, breaking ths fast of the day, a great shout went up from the city, which we could plainly hear - *rith the noiss of drums and music.

Pacha, an unolo Of tho young Khodive - and then the hugs palace which belonged to his great grandmother, and where all her servants and re*

The hospital is now what was formerly the Kaer el-Ain barrack*, and is very large, in the form of a parallelogram -and has about 400 patients* Barren and comfortless as it is in raanf respects, it was clean, and had not a particle of hospital odour about it. There is a pleasant looking house within the walls, near themen-trance gate, but quite apart from the hospital, which is the horn* of the nurses. We were welcomed by Vise Bishop, who went about with us -a tall, fair, nice looking young woman, fresh as a rose* In all the

as if she were moved by an invisible force. 1 raised my lorgnette to look at hff# ^and she'at once imitated the movement even to spreading 2 fingers9 ead peering at me through them. It was most curious. The most interesting thing I saw though, was a merry little black boy of about .4 years, clean and nice, who hung about kiss Bishop all the time, who was most affectionate with him. He went everywhere with ua she called him Jimmy, and ha called her Sister. When 1 remarked upon hie very attractive face, aha said, 02 this our li + tle prisoner of war the son of the great Dervieh general and Prince, 'Wad el-Kejenne, who was killed in the battle of Toeki - this bey was found on the battle field, then only a baby of 6 months, and given into the charge of a Nubian woman and sent to Cairo by Gen. Grenfell, and committed to the care of the Sisters at the hospital. He is quite an important little personage, and may perhaps have a role to nlay in the future. Miss Bishop says the Soudanese often come to pay homage to him, and for a year or two, he wae not allowed outside the walls of the hospital for fear he might be captured. He gravely drew himself up, when we came

Kiss Bishop took us up to the roof of the hospital, which erne quite any protecting parapet or balustrade at the sides. It ferns the exercise ground for the women, and it looked very curious as we dr ore away, to see those draped figures against the sky. We

Then Brother Julian turned us into the monastery garden running along one great wing Of the convent - and we picked violets and dal else, and sat in the graie looking off into the wide valleys eo far below ue - when suddenly one of the under brothers appeared in breathless hurry to eay we must come out at once, that no woman had ever been allowed there beforeand gave ue the impression that the end of the world was at hand, in consequence of our innocent transgression. So much disgruntled We withdrew our dangerous persons - and Brother Julian soon reappearing we told him. He seemed amused and perplexed by it - and in his simple, frank way, excused them - but it was very plain to see, from a very bread and higher ground - and I think the American brother disdained many of the restrictions and traditions of the monastery.
#e walked about with him for awhile, and as th* convent gates closed at 6 o'clock, and Fielding and Howard had to be within them at that hour, we said goodnight to brother- Julian, and the ooys went down with Annie and ms to St. Agatha’s for a fear minutes. The house was kept

The ride from Horae this morning van delicious. I have never seen Italy before in such entire opring costume. The whole country is bitterly in need of rain, and cro^o will be a serious failure if it does not come soon. Mr. Melding had engaged rooms for us at the Hew

away - while Theodore, Nettie and I lingered orer every detail - fairly enrooting teae of those mellow and time worn ornamental surfaces. There hare been aaay restorations - chiefly in the pavement - which look questionable • however necessary they night have been. Their exact level and aocurate outlines seem so inartistic, in comparison with the rich eld marbles and irregular surfaces. The strange undulating surface Of the pavement with its beautiful Alexandrian work is always such a delightful feature. We then went to the Church of San Salvatore. where is an Annunciation by Titianf painted in hie 89th year - angels and oloade above, the Uadonna with a look of glad surprise, and the Angel of Annunciation to the left, with the rush of descent still in his bearing - a grand thing - but little light to see it by. From there ve went to	, Crlgflltttflg. where is a.great picture of
r.4>wiini Halllnl of a.Li. Jerome, Cristopher and Augustine finished in 1513, in his 87th ysar, it had all bellini'a beauty of colour, and a most sweet religious sentiment. In the same church is a pAinting above the hAgh altar of Sebastian del Piombo. of SS. CrisOstom, John, \ugustlne, Liberal!, Catherine, Agnes and “agdalen. The faces of the women and the colouring fine - painted under the influence of Giorgione.
In \hk tfWfrnbta/iettie^and I rent to the 3. Ueharla. b church not ftfBfiM’thn *lv**dei SihUttiRl - with a beautiful natlituiot fayade, ^

and a a«MM anthroned with four saints by Giovanni Bellini • and the nativity .f John th. Baptl.t by Tintoretto over the door of the sacristy.
Th. .ham of going about Venice, threading one's way through one little canal after another, with charms and surprises at every turn • then, perhaps Stepping at a little flight of steps, as we did at S. Zac carl a, walking*through an areh, or a narrow calls or alley, into a quiet little eanpo, lie truly enchanting. But it takes time to get about in this way, and after we had gone to 3. Marla Formosa to see Faina Vecchls's
magnificent Barbara, it was time to come home.

Theodore, Nettie and I put in the whole morning at the Academia, and came hone to lunch in a limp condition. Nr. Berenson had narked oar books for us, tolling us what was most worth seeing, which was a great boon, uu our ti^e is so short. We first looked at a Madonna and child by Qlov. Bellini - and another Madonna with 8t. Catherine and a Uagdalen; remarkable for the beauty An the faces of the wonen. And still another Madonna with S.E. Paul and George -and another Madonna enthroned with SS. Francis, Job, John, Sebastian Dominic and Louis, with 3 angels on the steps of tho throne, playing on instruments - a lovely composition - Then, nt some nictures by Ciwa da Conegllano. an artist wbout whom I was wofully ignorant - a Madonna with John the Baptist, and St. Paul - another Madonna with

The Presentation in the tesiple by Titian, a gorgeous uass of lovely color - his 6t*->John in the Wilderness '«* his Entombment, painted in his 99th year it is said, and which indeed he left unfinished - and hie wonderful assumption, which seems to as a far greater work than Raphael's Transfiguration. fishermen presenting the Doge with the ring received from St. bark, by Parle Bordens* Banquet of Dives - Massacre of the Innocents, Solomon's Judgment, by Bonifacio* Madonna and child anl four senators - Death of Abel • Two Senators and St. Mark releasing n condemned slave, by Tintoretto* Cure of a Lunatic, with the Hialto bridge in the background - colour- perspective - architectural effects, and quaint detail. Presentation in the Temple - and the nine scenes from the fascinating logond of St. Ursula, painted for the school 01 that name in Vonloo, charmingly quaint and interesting by Carpaccio. Poter enthroned with other saints and the Assumption by Raima Veochio. The St, Ooorge of A. Mantegna, a small picture and very exquisite. Five delightful little cabinet pictures, Allegories, by Giov. Bellini - and the very interesting large pic ture of Gentile Bellini's. The finding of a portion of the true Cross - and The Procession in the Fiesta of St* Marks - from its minuto detail, it shows the changes which have taken place since 1496, when the picture was painted. In the afternoon we went to the Church of the Madonna del Orto. where is a picture

And the little square church, hardly larger than an ordinary sittim room, wainscoted with dark wood to the level on the narrow pictures, with the dark, low, ribbed ceiling, the beans gilded - and the two broad windows with their rod curtains, with the sun shining brightly in, made such a cheerful interior, that we said we felt like having afternoon tea there, and oringing our work!

Outside tho gate wo found the little carriage and its good natured looking driver, whom vo tad declined at the railway station, patiently waiting for his prey, and having three hours or more on our hands before we could take tho train back to Venice, decided that we would drive on to Dolo.

The chapel was smell - in the homanesqu* style - in excellent taste, and all the details well sxdcuted, the stained glass especially good in design and colour • the altar very good , and the Confessional richly carved. These three young people took such pleasure in it, and showed such reverence. They made many excuses then, and went off to mass at the neighboring estate of Bosworths - and Theodore and I roamed about gasing at the scenery - and the great stretches of park lands -such superb tress - such softness and richness. Then iisttie joined us and I took them into the chapel, and then we walked down through the park as Ur. de Trafford had suggested, and crossed the little river, and out through the lodge gates into the public road, down to the village, where ws found a typical Knglish church and churchyard * gray with age and covered with ivy. we found an interesting interior - part of the church belonging to the r orman period - with quaint old font, and inlaid pulpit.

We entered the firet floor with big dining room and library, really 3 rooms in one, the library with deep embrasured windows - bed roome, reception rooms and billiard room, all full of beautiful and interesting things -and then to the next floor, where were the state dining room and drawing room with walls cowered with family portraits and pictures - those in the drawing room mostly full length and built into the walls* There were 2 state bed rooms once occupied oy Queen idelaid with superb fur* niture and hangings in rose coloured brocade * ante rooms and sitting roome, until one's head was turned. The family portraits art interesting. The first Countess of Denbigh created in 162? was Susan Villiere, sister of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham - full length portrait of both of them by Van Dyke * am of the Duke of Hamilton and many others with strange histories, which Lady \gnes and Fielding rattled off to ue most amusingly.

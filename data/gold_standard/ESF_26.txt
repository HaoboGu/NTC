Best Beloved -	I regret to say that the pin forBob [sic: for Bob] Campbell is in my safety deposit box at the bank and that I cannot put my hand on the key.  You’ll just have to tell him about it, and send it to him later unless the enclosed permit works.  It is possible the men at the bank can open my box (it’s a new one in their new vaults) without my key.  I think there are two stickpins.  The one for Bob is the greeny-blue one, not the yellow one. 

Life drags on here in clouds and rain and gloom.  I love you very much and hope you are well and happy. 	Your loving
		Mim.

[page 1] D."Berlin"Nov. 17, 1912Dearest:       	Your Uncle says you are a splendid looking fellow an[d a] fine one. "And you are his Mother", he added.  "I am his proud and [happy?] Mother" I said.  To be justly a proud and happy Mother is to my thi[nking] the highest pinnacle of joy that a woman can attain.                                                                                	Auf Wiedersehen,  Beloved                                                                                                        	Mim                                                                                            	Tuesday Night, Nov. 26, 1912Darling Gopher -     	This voyage is almost over; - We are due in Na[?] in the morning at the crude hour of six, though we don’t have to ge[t?] until considerably later.  But, presumably, there will be bumpings bangings and yellings from five on so that sleep will be wooed in v[ain.]  The voyage has been a good one as voyages go.  This steamer is very [?] and most remarkably steady; the service is excellent, willing and m[ost] courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if y[ou] were so disposed.  The menus have included everything the plain Amer[ican] has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never heard [of?] from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dilled cucumber."After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we retu[rned] to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with baskets of fru[it], boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves.  One wondrous basket was from Nelso[n] and Wallace, and a box of chrysanthemums as big as cabbages with ste[ms] a yard long was from                        	.  We were an hour late i[n] sailing and didn’t start till twelve.Our one disappointment was the thick weather which prevented our hav[ing] anything more than very unsatisfactory glimpses of the Azores.  But Oh! Gibraltar!  The Sister-Kitty says she has written you all about [it?] but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you a more than faint id[ea] of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of that wonderful spot.  We did so hanker for you, - and Jones was the first to say it aloud, how much he wished you were there.Yesterday our first day in the Mediterranean was perfectly beautiful [with?] a smooth pale blue sea, and the splendid almost sinister coast of Af[rica] very near, with mountains so high there was snow upon their summits.  [It?] was after dark when we anchored before Algiers last evening and Cous[in] Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peer-less Jones.  "They are everyone of them beasts in that town" he said shortly, "There’s no knowing what they might say to you".  "Not with me there, sir," said Jones.  But he wouldn’t let us go.  However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in [the] moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely packed buildings [ris?]ing to the crest of the hill was a lovely spectacle from the deck of [the] ship.  Today the Mediterranean has been too choppy for perfect beauty but we’ve had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky mount[ain] ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits.  Baedeker says briefly that "public safely is not guaranteed to travellers in Sardinia."[page 2]Dear Cousin T. remarks at intervals what a fine fellow you are, and painstakingly explains again and again how it happened that he did not recognize you.  He is perfectly devoted to Doris and I am tickled almost to death.  He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he’d have a charming time.  "I’ve sometimes had such dreadful people", he added!I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy.  Please do if you possibly can, Dearest.  I’m so afraid the memory of this family may grow dim if he doesn’t see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that. Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells?  For D. a check for 250 francs to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I’m wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you.  My love to Jack and Wilson Foss.  Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear head.										Your very own											MimThe MediterraneanNorddeutscher Lloyd, BremenDampfer "Prinz Heinrich"							Sunday Dec. 1, 1912Darling Gopher -		The day we got to Naples was simply heavenly. I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel.  Also I posted 23 other letters and notes that I’d written on the steamer.  As we were driving from the steamer to our hostelry, the Grand Hotel, Doris and I grinning with delight over everything we saw, our carriage was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whittaker.  I think I told you on my post card from Naples that Jim came all the way from Florence to meet us.  And Giulio Tedeschi sent word that he would have given his sou[l] to come also, but couldn’t leave his sick mother.  We had a perfect time that first day - it was so beautiful, and I’m wondering why I hated Naples so that long ago time when I was a girl. After we had seen our quarters at the hotel, we all, except for Connie E., went driving along a wonderful mountain road above the city to Posolippo, with ecstatic views.  In the afternoon while naps were being taken by the Elders, Jim and Doris and I went to the Aquarium, stopping on our way by the seawall to see a lot of fishermen drawing in a seine.  They did it with a rhythmic stamping of the feet and wild shouts and as much enthusiasm as though they did not do it twice every day of their lives.  The Aquarium is wonderful - such extraordinary denizens of the deep, and all from the Mediterranean.  Later in the afternoon we all went to Bertolini’s for tea. First you drive zigzagging up and up a mountainous road.  Then you leave your carriage and walk by means of a tunnel into the heart of the mountain.  There you take a lift and go up for what seems like a mile, whereupon you step out on a verandah that seems like a terrace in the skies, with the city far below, - the bay, with [page 3; hw 18] Vesuvius to the left and Capri, the Beautiful, in the near distance guarding the entrance to the harbor; and, to the right a dull red classic sunset burning behind a sloping row of cypresses and pines.  It was so beautiful it was hard to believe it true.  The next day was hor[rible/rid?] weather and the only thing of interest that we did was the museum, to which Jim and Doris and I went in the morning.  But there is never-failing amusement from the windows of the Grand, which is close to the water, with a constant drilling of soldiers in the street by day, and minstrelsy by night. We boarded this steamer at about 10:30 Friday A.M. in the midst of the wildest confusion (I fancy it’s always that way in this voluble and excitable land).  Jim came down to say goodbye and then betook himself to his train.  We were to have sailed at 12 but were two hours late because of a gruesome accident.  They were lowering a huge bale of sacks of potatoes into the hold when it escaped a guiding hand and smashed a poor man to death against the side of the steamer.As we sailed out past Capri and the coast of Italy unfolded "where the waves and mountains meet", it was a sight of breathless beauty.  We were, unfortunately, asleep when we passed through the Straits of Mess[ina.]  Today we have had a dim, dim glimpse of Crete, and it’s getting deliciously warm.  We are due in Alexandria about noon tomorrow, and should be in Cairo in time for dinner.  Harry Burton is too amusing for words.  He is a most delightful addition to our party.  I only wish he were going to live on the dahabeah instead of up in the Valley.  All blessi[ings] on you dear head.  I think you ought to give something to some poor person for Christmas; - a turkey sent to Mrs. Tornberg, 90 Wolcott St. would be a charity indeed and could be ordered before you leave for Cleveland. I thought of you at Pomfret Thanksgiving Day.  It was hard to realize in Naples, (with nothing at all to mark the day except the many, many things we have to be thankful for), that in our native land, Turkey and Cranberry were reigning supreme. I meant to stop this letter on the last sheet with my benediction. N[ow] I must, in order to write to your grandmother. 							Your loving, loving									Mim.Please write to your grandmother at Christmas time. It’s possible sh[e] may be in Indianapolis at the time, but "Gambier, Ohio" will always reach her. 					The Egyptian Hotels Ltd Cairo					Shepheard’s Hotel & Ghezireh Palace					5 December, 1912Darling Gopher -  I don’t know what I wouldn’t give if you were her[e,] you’d love it so, and you wouldn’t have the patience to read a quar[ter] of it if I should even try to give you a description.  I mailed you [a?] letter form Naples and another from Anexandria [sic; Alexandria], so this makes my th[ird.][page 4]Entering Alexandria was one of the most beautiful things I ever did,- and the scenes on the wharf - the strange tribes and peoples, the wonderful colors, the turbans, the fezes, the Turkish trousers and gold embroidery, the superb figures of the Arabs in their long straight robes, the vociferations and gesticulations, - it was all a mad and wholly delightful confusion.  None of us ever have to look after a single piece of our forty-something pieces of luggage, except one small black bag with Cousin Emma’s jewels.  Jones and Amelie look after everything, and we simply sail along empty-handed and take possession of comfortable train-compartments reserved in large red letters for "Davis Pasha".  Cousin Theodore has been coming to this hotel for 20 years so we are a sort of Royal Party here and are the recipients of more salaaming and devotion that anything less than Royalty often gets.  It was late Monday evening when we reached here, and we vanished at once in[to] the gorgeous suite reserved for us.  But the next morning as we were standing on the terrace waiting for our motor car, and watching monkeys and cobras and mongooses performing on the sidewalk, who should fall upon us from the rear but Mrs. Tonzalin and Charlotte. We have been to the museum and have seen the wonderful Theodore M. Davis Room with all its marvels and beauties, and have been presented (Doris and I) to Sir Gaston Maspero who presented us with the freedom of the Museum, and gave us each a grey and gold permit "de visiter tous les monuments, fermes ou enclos de la Haute-Egypte."  We have visited our dahabeah, the Beduin, twice and are wild about it.  Once, when the Elders were napping, Harry Burton, D. & I paid a delirious visit to the native bazaars and saw more queer things in an hour than in all our live[s] put together before.  We have been to the Pyramids!!! (Haven’t seen the Sphynx as yet.)  We have motored out and out into the desert until the whole world seemed made of grey and shifting sand in desolate sweeps, high ridges and deep hollows.  We’ve been to the Zoo, - one of the nicest ones I ever saw.  We've been to the Citadel, and have entered the wonderful Mosque of Mohammed Ali with sacred yellow slippers as big as barges on our profane tootsies.  But after all it is the strange and crowded and kaleidoscopic street life which is the most enthralling part of Cairo to us so far.  Such startling sights which no one but such as we even turn to look at.  Doris could ride through Cairo on a camel and not begin to attract the attention she does in New Haven on a horse.  A splendid Arab in a long straight robe of heavenly blue strides across a thoroughfare with three dried crocodiles under his arm and 615 Orange St. is the only thing that notices him.  It’s all of it perfectly gorgeous. But we hanker to hear from you.  I’ve had a letter from Adeline, one fro[m] Grandmother, and one from Katie from Cooraclare, Ireland; and D. has had missives from Marion and Clara.  Perhaps the next steamer will bring one from you.  I omitted to send a message - a Christmas message for Clara to enclose with my present to you.  But you know - or ought - what oceans and oceans of love go with it. God bless my boy and keep him safe.  A Merry Christmas and A Truly Happy New Year.								Your loving Mother[page 5; hw 20]								Shepheard’s Hotel								Cairo								9 December, 1912Darling Gopher - The cable which John sent me telling of his father’s death was five days late in being delivered to me.  I cabled at once to Auntie Paige, and of course followed that message immediately by a lett[er.]  If they telegraphed you I do hope you did the proper thing.  I cannot he[lp] feeling very anxious about Paige.  She has been under such a tremendous strain for so long that I’m afraid under the sudden cessation of it she may go to pieces.  Of course you will go to see her at once in Clevelan[d] and I beg you to write me at once all about her.  I hope Winifred has taken the baby to Cleveland.  Nothing in the world could divert Paige or help her as much as that baby.Your letter of the 21 Nov. reached me Saturday the 7th and rejoiced me through and through.  I’m also glad that you have decided to live at th[e] Hall - if it is not going to interfere with your work and keep you up too late at night.  As to your surgical operation, I do not anticipate any trouble at all from that.  Nevertheless I shall want a line of immediately - sooner than you will feel like writing it; so arrange with the doctor or one of your friends to write me at once.  If it were a more serious thing I should, of course, want a cable.We go on living in the Arabian Nights.  We had tea yesterday afternoon on the dahabeah, with the most wonderful lights on the river-that haunting river Nile; white walled palaces, backed by towering palm trees, gleaming out on the opposite shore; a fleet of boats with their beautiful, slanting sails moving so slowly that they seemed not to move at al[l] until suddenly you found they had vanished around a bend.  Before our guests arrived we were immensely amused by a little scene enacted on [the] bank to which the Beduin is tied.  We have a snow-white cock and three hens, a gorgeous drake and three ducks which we take with us when we set sail, and which made the voyage up the river last year.  The ducks were off visiting a neighboring dahabeah yesterday when we arrived, but when whistled for came paddling up for dear life.  In the meantime the cock and hens had wandered along the bank till they arrived at the pla[ce] close to the boat, which the drake regards as his own domain.  Instantly the drake waddled out of the water and made for the cock, dabbing at hi[s] legs until he drove him off.  In his pride of victory and the attitude he struck he really looked like Napoleon. Our guests were Prof. Sayle, an Oxford Don, explorer and scientist, Artin Pasha, an Armenian archaeologist of distinction, and an Egyptian gentleman, Claudius Bey, whose hair turned snow white a few years ago when upon going on board a steamer, just landed in Alexandria, to meet his wife - he found her lying in her stateroom with her throat cut.  She had been murdered by a steward.I talked with Prof. Sayle for some time, or rather I listened while he talked.  He told me some inside history about Gordon, which was absorbingly interesting, - particularly so to me as Gordon has always been on[e] of my heroes.  We had expected to move onto the dahabeah today and sail tomorrow but we’ve been delayed a day.  Not that I care - for I’ve not begun to see the wonders of this city.  After church yesterday morning [page 6; hw 21] Harry Burton and I went to see the Blue Mosque, -a beautiful, half ruined structure, parts of whose walls are covered with superb Persian tiles in blue and white.  Hundreds of young men and boys were sitting about in groups on the floor reciting the Koran aloud.  The weather is heavenly.  We wear our winter clothes and Cousin Theodore declares it cold, but I am basking in warmth, except in the evening.Give my dear love to Mr. and Mrs. Eells and the young people.  The Sister-Kittie is in high favor and I am very happy. A Happy, Happy New Year to you my darling.					Your loving						Mim						Monday, 16 December, 1912On the Nile somewhere between Roda and Asyut, and about 180 miles from Cairo. 				DAHABYA BEDUIN					EGYPTDarling Gopher -	This is the best paper and I shall not use it often in writing to you, but I am giving you a treat as long as this is my first letter to you from the boat.  I’d give anything if you were here.  It is impossible to convey by written description any adequate idea of t[he] incomparable river and the scenes through which it winds.  And how it winds! We almost ... the compass in our meandering.  And it would take a whole day’s writing, and result in a letter you would carry about with you - possibly - but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of scenery.  The principal towns are on the west shore, and it is on that shore that the railroad from Cairo to Luxor runs, and there is enough of ceaseless interest on that side to hold you spellbound from the cool early morning through the glowing day tothe [sic; to the] moonlit dusk.  But it’s nothing to the Eastern Shore with its desert stretches,  its cultivated str[eets?] and terraces, its palm groves, its native villages so absolutely fascinating that each one fills me with delight, some of them are are walled abou[t] and those always have towering palms growing within the walls;  the unwalled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert sand out of which they rise and the desert hills into which they melt without one speck of anything green about them.  And always on that magic Eastern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, sometimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground.  Absolutely bleak and bare, of the strangest shapes, long stretches of them where surely no human foot has ever been, then long stretches where they have been quarried for building stone, or tunneled for tombs.  Yesterday morning we sailed close to the foot of the gigantic limestone cliffs that rose precipitously out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t[o] ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that came rolling and crashi[ng] to the water’s edge to be loaded on barges.  The sunlight on this scene made a blinding glare.  Ang [sic; And] the people - the picturesque people - no stretch so barren but that you can always see those stately shrouded figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, fishing, sitting motionless brooding by the river, praying with their faces to the East, women filling their water jars and striding up the bank with the full jars on their heads, disdaining to touch them even with one hand, people going and coming along the road - on foot, on donkeys, on camels (always camels and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the shore shepherded by one or two cloaked and hooded figures.  And on the river itself great barges loaded with cotton, with grain, with water jars packed so that they look like cream colored cannon balls, - or merely boats filled with [page 7] people, but each and every craft carrying the lateen sail, so beautifu[l] in its sweep even when its canvas is a crazy mess of tatters.We are almost criminally comfortable, and systematically over-fed - or would be if we ate all that was set before us.  The Beduin draws only 14 inches of water, and being towed, slides forward with such a total absence of motion that if it were not for the scenery slipping by we w[ould] not know we were moving at all.  There are 22 people on board just to take care of us four.  We tie up every night anywhere we happen to be at sunset.  The tying-up process is as follows.  We draw up to the bank.  One of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder and worries it into the sane [sic; sand].  Two of the crew carry huge wooden pins as b[ig] as hitching posts, ashore and two more of the crew armed with mallets made of sections of tree trunk hammer the pins into the sand and we ar[e] tied to those.  Jones is always armed in case we are lying near a nati[ve] village that might be inclined to depredations.We hope to reach Asyut tonight where there ought to be much mail awaiting us, and where this will be posted.  We do not expect to reach Luxo[r] till the 21st at the earliest.  Goodbye for now my Darling.  It’s a month today since we sailed and this is my 4th letter to you besides pst [sic; post] cards.  I shall be very anxious to hear how you are after your lit[tle] operation, so don’t fail to carry out the instructions I sent you in m[y] last about having someone write to me at once. 							God bless my boy							       With all my love 								        Your Mim							Dahabya Beduin							On the Nile - tied up nearNag Hamadi, Friday 20 Dec. 1912Darling Gopher -   Doris and I went ashore at Asyut, under the escort of Hareem to take a drive through the city.  The beduin could not get close to the shore so we were landed in the felucca with six Nubians rowing it with a man-of-war’s-men precision.  We landed at the foot of [a?] steep, high bank done in rough masonry, and before I had time to wonde[r] how on earth I was to climb  it I found myself at the top.  A trusty mariner at each elbow had wafted me thither.  There’s never the sligh[test] fuss, - a nod, a single word from the person in command and the thing [is] done as if by magic.  It was the same when we returned from our Asyut spree.  The Beduin and the felucca had moved up the steam to a spot [where] even the felucca couldn’t make a landing.  A word form Hareem [and] D. and I were picked up deftly, carried through the water and set down gently into the boat.    		 It was market day in Asyut and the entire population was apparently in the streets.  We drove through the bazaar and [the?] market where men, women, children, bulls, camels, donkeys were in one grand mass.  It is a large, important, rich town, with many elaborate houses belonging to natives, and during our entire drive we saw not [a] single white person.In spite of the delights in store for us I hate to have this heavenly voyage end.  To all the enchantments of the shores have lately been added the most wonderful flocks of birds.  The Sister-Kittie announced yesterday when we joined her on deck that a flight of at least a thousand cranes had passed overhead, and not all our efforts could ma[ke] [page 8] her come down one crane.  I myself counted sixty-two pelicans sitting on a sandbar.  And today we sailed by close to Kasz-es-Sayad ("the Hunter’s Castle"), and what easily might be a castle is nothing more nor less that [sic; than] a colossal pigeon-house.  Hundreds of thousands of pigeons were perching on the battlements or flying about them, and little flocks were hastening home to them from all directions.  They are bred in this land as much for their droppings, which make a much-prized fertilizer, as for food.  (That’s a horrid sounding sentence but you will understand what I mean).  On the West bank of the river, opposite the Hunter’s Castle, is the little town of Hou where for 53 years Shieck Selim sat stark naked on the bank of the Nile.  He died a few years ago, and they built a tomb on his sitting place to which the natives make pilgrimages.  Clothes seem rather lightly esteemed in Egypt.  If the day is warm the Shaduf workers wear practically the same garb as the Apache Indian, and their beautiful bodies look like bronze.  We were passing quite close to the shore when a gentleman bounded down the banks, yanked off his one and only garment and proceeded to do is [sic; his] laundry work in the Nile. Sunday - 22nd December.  The Beduin, Luxor. 		At noon yesterday - and a day soaked in sunshine - we came in the sight of Luxor, and a short time thereafter had reached its outskirts, and from the window of a dahabya tied to the east bank the pleasant, tousled head of Nicole, an English artist, bowed and called greetings to Cousin Theodore.  Past some charming looking hotels we slipped, catching glimpses in between of the most beautiful columns of the Temple of Luxor, past the Winter Palace Hotel, and then diagonally across the rive [sic: river] to our mooring place on the west shore.  We have it all to ourselves at present, the other boats preferring to be in the thick of everythin [sic: everything] on the east bank.  But we have a beautiful sandy beach on which the crew have pitched their tent, and where we instantly established the poultry yard.  The three coops were taken from the dahabya put on the sand and opened.  Sir Francis Drake and his three ladies waddled madly for the bank, slid down it on their tails and launched themselves joyously upon the water.  The White Cock stepped daintily forth, lonely but still gallant.  All his wives were eaten on the way up.  But seldom are widowers so soon consoled - by 9 a.m. today he had three more.  The turkey cock and his consort emerged from their coop so stiff they could hardly stand up.  But they were soon limbered, and the gobbler strutted and rustled and gobbled as though he owned the earth.But Oh my dear! if you could see what lies beyond our beach!  A great plain with stretches of sand and stretches of lovely green, and clumps of trees, and then the fierce and glaring and beautiful Lybian mountains making a mighty wall beyond.  I cannot give you any idea of how wonderful it is.  I could have spent the whole afternoon looking, but I suddenly went wild with neuralgia in my face and took to my bed and suffered torments for hours, and then - as suddenly - the pain left and I slept all night, and got up this morning ready for anything.  I wanted to go to church this a.m. but Cousin Emma objected as my face was still swollen and she said the church was always cold. This afternoon when Cousin Theodore had had his nap, he, Doris, I and Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed across the river in the felucca.  Our donkeys were awaiting us in front of the Winter Palace, the donkey boys (old retainers) kissed our hands and off we started for Karknak.  We could only take a most cursory look at thos [sic: those] stupendous ruins - actually inconceivable until you stand in their presence.[page 9; hw 24] It was lovely the way lines of dragomans and donkey boys along the road would rise to their feet beaming and shouting welcomes to Cousin T.We got quite a lot of letters yesterday, but my dearest one was from you,-the one of Dec. 1, telling about the Harvard game, and your Thanksgiving, and the chillblains - poor darling - they do hurt so dreadfully.  I suppose you are in Cleveland tonight, or will be shortly.  I love to [?] of you with those dear people since I may not have you myself.  And I fancy that Arthur’s death will prevent the excess of gaiety you were dreading. They open the big dam at Assouan tomorrow, and the Khedive passed throu[gh] Luxor today on his way there, but the only indication of him that we sa[w] was the many flags with which Luxor is decorated.  I suppose Lord Kitch[ener?] went through too.  I’d rather see Lord K. than any man alive. Goodnight dear love - God bless my boy and grant him a Happy, Happy New Year.									Your loving										Mim					Christmas Night					   Luxor, 1912Darling Gopher - 	The nicest things that happened to me today were receipt of your letter of Dec. 7, and the fact that Emily Morgan spent a little part of the day with us.  Those two things kept me from wholly succumbing to homesickness.  I felt its touch on my shoulder, so to spe[ak] all day long.  The Serapis and Mr. Tuck and his party, of which Emily and Miss Nelson are two-ninths, came down from Aswan yesterday.  They waved from the deck as they steamed by us, and soon after luncheon we went ov[er] to the Serapis to call.  Emily is certainly one of the sweetest things [in?] all the world.  I was as glad to see her as if she were my very own. I hung up my stocking as I’ve never missed doing, but the Sister-Kittie refused to indulge in what she seemed to consider an empty form without a chimney piece to hang them by.  Cousin Theodore gave us his presents in Cairo - a pearl and diamond ring to Doris, and a stunning gold mesh purse to me.  Doris gave me a beautiful red linen cover with embroidery for my table; Cousin Emma gave me an inlaid sandalwood box, Dick Baker gave me another one.  (Doris was his agent).  The Mitchell ladies, Mrs Hoppin and Aunt Mabel had all sent me packages to bring ov[er] with me.  Jones gave Doris and me each a little silver seal with our initials in Arabic engraved on it.  We were much touched by this gift.  And Mohammed Muhassef, the best known and most reliable antiquity deal[er] here, sent D. & me each a scarab.  Cousin T. has had many dealins [sic: dealings] with [him] so every Christmas he sends a present to each member of Cousin T’s par[ty.]  After the breakfast things were cleared from the table, the ceremony of giving the crew their presents took place.  Cousin T. & Cousin E. sat [at] the table, D. & I on the divan, and Jones was master of ceremonies.  T[he] crew and inside servants came in one by one, kissed our hands, said "Kulle sana w’inta taiyih" (A Happy New Year to you), and each receiv[ed] a white shawl, a box of cigarettes, a bag with candy and nuts, and some money, and departed beaming.  When they all had had their presents the[y] gathered on the deck and shouted "Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooray!  T’ank you, t’ank you, t’ank you", and we retired to our several apartments and washed our hands in dioxygen.[page 10][T]hen the felucca took Doris and me across the river, and Harry Burton [m]et us at the steps (he is stopping at the Winter Palace, there being no [r]oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church which [i]s away at the rear of a garden filled with palms and acacias and other [l]ovely things, and where an Arab was ringing the bell outside, as they did [i?]n "Bunty".  And Emily joined us inside.  It was very comforting to me [t]o have her go to church with us this far land on this Day of Days.  [W]hen we came back to the Beduin we brought Harry and Mr. Crane (a young [E]nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crane) to luncheon.  [A]fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymkana in the Winter Palace [g]ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for tea so we couldn’t.  The [T]ucks came and Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were [c]razy about the boat, and we had a lovely time.  They go on their way to Cairo tomorrow at one. 		We had such a perfectly enormous [d]inner tonight with only the four of us to eat it that by the time the turkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, and have it carried off unscathed, for we had to eat plum pudding.  Jones having heard me remark that I was going to break over my total abstinence on Christmas in order to drink a toast to you, had supplied champagne from the wine cellar, wherever that may be.  The Cousins never touch champagne, so Doris and I drank alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank a comprehensive toast to "all the people I love".We had a splendid mail awaiting us when we got back from church this morning.  It was so good to have it come on Christmas Day.  I do hope you got my first letter very soon after you sent yours.  I think I explained in it that people told us on no account to post letters at Gib. because it sometimes took months for them to reach their destinations from there.  So I only mailed you a postcard from there & sent my first letter from Naples the minute we landed on the 27th.Dec. 26th.  Doris and I mounted on our gallant donkeys, (mine is named Sugar) and followed by our donkey boys (mine is named Mahmoud) rode off this morning towards the Libyan mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi - see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot.  The figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, making the entire height 65 ft.  Even in this land of mighty marvels they seem all that there is of the extraordinary.	  Well, dearest, dozens of other letters must be written, so fare thee well for now. Endless love and many blessings on your belove [sic: beloved] head. Your very own       Mim Dahabya Beduin    Luxor - 1 January 1913Happy New Year, Best Beloved.		I got up early so as to make my greeting to you the first one I either uttered or wrote.  And I wrote it just in time, for in another two minutes Amelie came in with my orange juice,- which is my waking ceremony every morning. The principal thing that has occurred since my last week’s letter to you was our visit to the Valley.  We all went out last Friday, Doris, Cousin T. and Jones riding, and Cousin E and I driving.  It’s seven miles.  I meant to ride also, but I found Cousin Emma hated to drive [page 11; hw 26] alone so I went with her.  Our vehicle was a sort of surrey thing draw[n] by two mules and driven by a pirate in baggy white "trou."  When we finally entered the Valley my breath was taken away.  It was like driving on a very good, glaring white road through the wreck of the world.  Absolutely the desert, not a suggestion of a growing thing anywhere.  Towering cliffs all about us, wild masses of rock hurled everywhere, l[ife?]less stretches of broken fragments of flint and limestone and fossiliz[ed] shells, the blazing sun, the splendid cloudless sky.  The house is in what is called the West Valley, which, though it contains two or three tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs, being divided from that by a ridge.  The house is long, low (one storied) flat-roofed, made of roug[h] stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican houses.  It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cliffs directly behind it and a stone’s throw across the road in front of it another ridge dividing it from a third valley.  The bedrooms are like cells with little s[lits?] of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls.  The sitting room is ba[re?] and mannish and the dining room ditto, - but all very neat.  Harry Bur[ton] is a delightfully orderly person.  You know he is managing your uncle’[s] excavations and so lives out there in the house.  All the water used t[oo/here?] is brought miles in jars on donkeyback - as it was in Ecuador. Threr [sic: There] [is?] an excellent cook, and a houseboy and two guards.  A guard armed with [a] rifle stands at the front corner of the house all night. Saturday morning we all proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin T[.] mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair carrie[d] by two men and D. & I on foot.  It was a sensation of a lifetime to visit that place for the first time.  A number of tombs are open to th[e] public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his des[ire.?]  But Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the valley, it was amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gaping tourists and disapp[ear] into an opening labelled "No Admittance" from which were issuing clouds of dust and a procession of children carrying dirt and rocks in baskets which they emptied on a dump.  Most of the manual labor in excavations in this region is done by children and I hate it.  They are urged on b[y] overseers with whips.  But our overseer was deprived of his whip last year when Harry saw him cut a piece out of a boy’s leg with the lash. Time fails to tell you of the marvels of the tombs we saw.That afternoon I took a walk alone and climbed a ridge and went down into another valley and up on the ridge beyond.  And the sun went down, and without sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saw.  The silence was dr[ead]ful, and I was suddenly siezed with a horror of the desert and fled ba[ck] to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off  by myself.  Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our tooties explore[d] the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why all the kings didn’t make their tombs there I cannot understand.  It is the most regal, stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saw. Cousin Emma and I came home to the Dahabya Monday morning and glad enough we were to get here.  But Cousin Theodore and Doris tarried til[l] yesterday.  He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it.  But it would get on [my] nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations and were really living there. [page 12; hw 27]We had a wonderful mail today, but no letter from you.  We had a wonderful ride this afternoon, Cousin T., D. & I. over to Medinet Habu, near the foot of the mountains, where there are the most beautiful ruins we’ve seen yet.Goodnight, Darling, and God bless my boy.						Your Loving							Mim				West Bank at Luxor - 10 January 1913Darling Gopher -	It’s more than two weeks since I’ve heard from you and I’m beginning to be afraid that a letter must have been lost.  As for me I’ve written you with the utmost regularity, beginning with a postal from Gib, followed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in Naples on the 27th, pursued by another mailed at Alexandria Dec. 2, since which I’ve written once a week.  A letter just arrived from Jack Stewart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has written you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter".  Of course I am wholly mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remoteness will begin to be intolerable. Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency and the days flit by on the wings of the wind.  I bask in constant sunlight, and wear summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin Theodore persistently refers to me, when speaking to Doris, as "Your sister".  Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry Burton this morning before breakfast saying that he had found (in a new sepulchral chamber he opened a few days ago) a red granite sarcophagus with a recumbent figure carved on the lid.  The note further said it would take about two days to clear away the debris in which it is embedded.  Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and await developments.  I want to go also, but it isn’t fair to leave Cousin Emma alone so I’m going to stay with her.  I think I shall ride part way with them for the sake of the ride, and then come back alone with Mahmoud, my donkey boy - and possibly one of the crew.  When Cousin T., D. & I go out we are quite a cavalcade - we three mounted, and three donkey boys and two sailors running beside us.  I’ve come to the reluctant conclusion that my donkey, Sugar, has too small a tummy to clinch a sidesaddle to.  My saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount and hold up the procession and have it readjusted.  Jones thought it might be the fault of the saddle, and, in his determination to have me suited, the other day he, assisted by two donkey boys and six of the crew, saddled and unsaddled that one small donkey with various sidesaddles while all Luxor looked on.  But no sidesaddle stays put for more than fifteen minutes on Sugar, so I think I’ll have to give him up.  I hate to,- he’s so pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim. Sunday afternoon we took a rather unusual ride, not visiting any ruins (which is what we almost always do) but riding through miles of cultivated fields where steam ployghs [sic: ploughs] were at work and the water flowing through cemented irrigating ditches,- all more modern and progressive than anything we have seen, and quite dull and uninteresting compared with the native methods.[page 13; hw 28] Tuesday night Doris and I made our first plunge into Luxor society.  There are some perfectly charming Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, staying at the Winter Palace, and they invited D. & me to dine and stay for the regular Tuesday evening dance.  It was such a fascinating way to go to dinner, - to step into an immaculate felucca and go skim[ming] down the starlit river with six white durbans bowing rhythmically bef[ore] us as the men bent to their oars; then to be escorted by two of our c[rew?] bearing lanterns, up to the entrance of the hotel, and to find them standing like statues awaiting us when we left the hotel at eleven.  Doris met some awfully amusing young Englishmen, two or three of whom could actually dance well, and I enjoyed myself immensely just talkin[g] to people. We’ve just had a Baron and Baroness Von Bissing lunching with us.  He is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon.  The resemblance is too amusing.  We see by the Paris Herald that George Bourne has been married.  I wonder if he will come out here on his wedding journey. You will now be able to tell me something of Mrs. Moses.  I’ve writte[n] twice without getting  an answer to either missive.  I cannot understand it.  Please be sure to send me her new address, though I should think Savannah, Georgia would reach her.  And have you been to see Kim?  Please go!  I can’t bear to have him forget his family.  Dr. Nolte is the name, and you can find the address in the telephone book. Endless love from us both and please write to your adoring							Mim.I hope you wrote to your grandmother at Christmas time.  If you have[n’t] done so, do it now for my sake.  She wrote me she sent you a couple books. 							West Bank at Luxor							23 January, 1913Darling Gopher -	Your letter of the 8th arrived today, - fift[een] days is pretty quick work, the quickest possible I fancy.  I was awf[ully] glad to get it, and I am also glad to be able to tell you that it’s quite all right with Mr. Eells as well as with Mrs., for I had a fi[ne?] long letter from him on Sunday expressing much disappointment, but [no?] traces of annoyance at your failure to come to Cleveland.  He is so sensitive I was afraid he might think you went to Savannah merely because you preferred to.  Congratulations on having passed your exams [and] also on having done the nice thing at Christmas by Nan, and others i[ncluding?] your grandmother.  By the way, did you really - as man to man, mind [?] like your waistcoat?  Doris and I had an argument over it.  She mai[ntained?] you would think it vulgarly loud, while I insisted that there was n[o use] in getting a fancy waistcoat unless it was fancy, and I thought it w[ould] go very well with the Oxford grey clothes I made you get.  Bud Talb[ott?] had already, in a letter to me, broken the horrid news about Lefty [Flynn.?]  Cloister has certainly got a black eye this winter, nicht wahr? Various exciting things have happened "all in the blue, unclouded w[eeks"?] since my last letter.  On Sunday Doris and Cousin T., mounted on th[eir?] donkeys and accompanied by the peerless Jones, basely deserted Cous[in] [page 14; hw 29] Emma and me and trotted over to the Valley to spend the night’ while we had to sit tamely on deck like perfect ladies, and dispense tea and cakes to strange Americans from Buffalo whom we had never seen before.  Sir Gaston Maspero was to join them the next morning at the Tombs and pronounce judgement on the red granite sarcophagus.  The next afternoon I had just got back from a long walk (accompanied by a sailor with a heavy stick,) packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village I suddenly found myself in; and was having tea on deck in company with th[e] Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine when the cavalcade returned from the Valley.  It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning from the African desert as they came in single file across the sands; fir[st] the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris & Jones with the donkey boys running beside them, and Julius Caesar braying his head off as they came.  Doris was beaming.  She had had the most wonderful time with Maspero who had lunched with them in the House in the Valley and who talked as she never had heard anyone talk before.  He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in Cairo, but also wants Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of 250 poinds [sic: pounds] sterling for its transportation there!The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next day at the great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of a noted Arab snake-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the purpose.  We went, and it was an extraordinary experience.  (Doris had a nasty spill on the way out.  Her donkey stepped into a pitfall, flung her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, with her usual pluck, and in the end suffered no serious effects).  I simply haven’t the time to give you an account of what happened at the ruins.  It was both dramatic and astounding.  The Arab stalking in front of the picnic, who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incantation in a loud clear voice, and lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple wall. Yesterday I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace and carried off a cup (the 1st Prize),- not by my own prowess but by that of my partner, a very nice Scotchman named MacNaugton who played a corking game. This afternoon D. & I went over there again on invitation to watch a rather mild but quite amusing gymkhana, and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  And now I must turn in and get some of that sleep that I seem to require more here than anywhere else in the world.		I suppose now you cannot get that operation done till the Spring vacation. I wonder if postponing it was wise. 							Oceans of love, dearest, from									Your Mim. 							West Bank at Luxor							31 January, 1913Darling Gopher -	We are now wondering whether Edith was allowed to return to New Haven for the Prom proper.  In a letter Doris had from Dick he said he had met you on the street and you had told him of your hopes and fears (though he didn’t put it that way.)  I have a feeling that she did come back.  I fancy Mrs. Finch likes now and then to make a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense.  I shall await your description of the Prom with interest - and such patience as I can summon to my aid.  It’s two weeks since I’ve had a letter from you.  I was rejoiced yesterday by one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which [page 15; hw 30] combined the advantages of a long-desired missive from a friend and a puzzle.  She writes one of the most indecipherable hands I’ve ever encountered.  It seems Put had a very serious accident in football and [for] a time was in a dangerous condition.  That was what first took her out there.  Then she staid for Christmas, and now she is staying on through February just because she likes it. Nothing particularly thrilling has happened since my last letter.  The chief destination of our rides for the past week has been our new digg[ing] at Medinet Habu which is much nearer than the old diggings at the Tombs of the Kings.  Doris and I rode over there yesterday afternoon to cheer Harry up a bit.  He occasionally gets tired of not seeing a white pers[on] to speak to for days at a time.  I sat on a block of stone that had on[ce] been part of a temple pillar, and Doris wandered about picking up chun[ks] of carnelian, and my donkey boy took his clothes off - just why I cann[ot] say.  Fortunately he put them on again.  On leaving Harry to his diggi[ng] we rode up into a hollow in the Libyan Hills to see a temple we had not yet visited - a gem of a temple, called Der-el-Medineh.  The view alon[e] off towards the Nile though a wide cleft in the rocks was worth going far to see.  And the superb looking Arab, guardian of the place, was so moved by my present of seven cents that he knocked Mahmoud, my donkey b[oy,] out of the way and held my donkey himself while I mounted.  On our homeward way Doris left me on a mad gallop to catch up to a baby camel she saw in the distance.  The maternal camel was not pleased by this attenion and tried to take a bite out of Doris, but, happily, failed. I’ve been twice out to luncheon this week - once with the Fahnestocks on their Dahabya "Cheops", and once at the Winter Palace with the Piers.  The Piers are enchanting people and so nice to us.  They had Doris over for dinner and the dance again Tuesday night.  It is such a pleasure to her and I’m so thankful she can have it.  The incessant cardplaying is rather hard on her.  I tru [sic: try] to help out by playing dominoes as much as I can; but Cousin T. so much prefers bridge. Give my special love to Jack and tell him I live in hopes of finding t[ime] to answer his letter as it deserves.  My love to Wilson Foss.  And, dearest, to please me, bo [sic: go] and call on Mrs. Baker.  It isn’t decent not to when she has been so kind about asking you there. I made a mistake in saying it had been two weeks since I had a letter from you.  It’s only a little over one.  God bless my boy.  I have tim[?] of being very homesick for you.								Your loving								       Mim.									Luxor									8 February, 1913Darling Gopher - 	Your letter of January 16th came two or three days ago with its accounts of the Prom.  It was awfully nice for you, as well as for her, that Edith made such a hit.  I judge from what you an[d] others have written that this year’s Prom was more per-fervid than any that ever was before.  It’s a pity to let it become an insane orgy - f[or] that will eventually kill it.  It was quite noble of you to write to me so soon and shen [sic: when] you were still so nearly dead with fatigue. I enclos[ed] the order on the bank which you asked for, and I put in the P.S. just just to remind you not to absent-mindedly carry off the key.[page 16; hw 31] On Wednesday Doris and I had one of the pleasant chocks [sic: shocks] of our lives when a boat drew up beside the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet.  None of our Cleveland letters had mentioned that they were coming abroad so it was an absolute surprise.  They had come up the river on the Rameses III, and left for Aswan the next day, but they are to be here for a week on their return.  I went over to the Rameses to call on Mrs. Dodge.  I think she was quite cross because neither Paige nor Howard Eells had written me they were coming. Tuesday Doris and I had a lovely time.  Harry had invited us to come over to the valley so as to show us the tomb of Horemheh and me the sarcophagus in Siphtah, and then to have luncheon with him at the House.  We had breakfast an hour earlier than usual, and then started off on our donkeys with our donkey boys and a sailor as escort, and Jones to follow us soon as he had got Cousin Theodore started for the day.  We rode along the river’s edge as far as the ferry landing place directly opposite Luxor, before turning toward the Range.  The ferry landing that morning was worth going miles to see.  Two steamers had come up the night before and scores upon scores of people and donkeys and sandcarts and carriages had come across to take some of the numerous expeditions on this side.  The gay trappings of the donkeys, the blue and white clothes of the donkey boys with a dash of red on their chests all made fine coloring; seven native policemen in Khaki, with their cames [sic: camels] waiting for them in the background, the bustle and confusion and everybody yelling at once - it was all immensely entertaining to me.  It was a perfectly delicious day, like all our days, and I did enjoy the ride.  The light and color on the Libyan Range as we neared it were more marvellous than anything I’ve ever seen, -surpassingly beautiful, but so blinding we had to pull down our chiffon veils.  The tombs were intensely interesting, especially the paintings on the walls of Horemheh.  The unfinished part interested me even more than the beauty of the completed work;- it was just as thoug[h] the artist - dead thousands of years ago - had laid down his pencil and brushes to go home to luncheon.  Our luncheon at the House with Harry and Mr. Crane was a very jolly affair, and at three we started for home, getting back at teatime and finding the dahabya seething with people. One other day this week I was invited by the Contessa Contardone to go to Karnak with a small party, of whom the Russian Princess Gortschokoff was one.  Karnak is always one of the most wonderful places in the world, but that afternoon it was secondary in my eyes to the Princess with whom I fell madly in love.  Think of a Princess - a real one - like those in novels and storybooks; young, lithe, beautiful, fascinating, quiet and absolutely simple in her manner.  I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.  We watched the workman excavatin [sic: excavating] a large and beautiful jar and hoped it would be packed with jewels, but when it was emptied nothing but a brick materialized.  We paid a visit to the uncanny goddess Sekmet, she with the lion’s head.  It is a life-sized statue of black granite which stands in a dusky room in the temple of Ptah, lighted only by a small square window high up in the roof.  When you’ve looked at the creature for five minutes she seems so alive that you sympathize with the Arabs who believe that she sometimes prowls forth and eats people. 							Endless love, dearest, from									Your Mim.I long to see you.  I don’t know how I can wait till June.  Are you coming to any definite decision as to whether you will go to Utah or not next summer?  I had a letter from Mr. Walcott that shocked me greatly. [page 17; hw 32] He said that when Charlie was brought home in December they did not expect him to live more than six weeks; but that now there seemed a good chance of his recovery. 					My love to Jack and Wilson								M.							Luxor - 14 February 1913Darling Gopher - 	You are my best and only Valentine, and I wish you were here or I were there to tell you so, viva voce.  I have noth[ing] interesting to record this time of my personal doings because my whol[e] week has been given up to homesickness and rheumatism.  I have suffe[red] torments with sciatica or neuritis or some kindred of diabolical disease in my left leg; and I’ve not been off the boat since going to church last Sunday morning.  To make matters worse the sun - the brilliant, constant, revivifying Egyptian sun - has withdrawn its light for two whole days, and it actually rained all day yesterday, resulting in t[he] damp and cold and gloom on which rheumatism thrives.  But I’m glad it[’s] not Doris who is stricken down be [sic: by] her old enemy.  If she had to bear [it] in addition to her daily task of Bridge I think she’d go crazy.Day before yesterday when she came back from a morning across the ri[ver] at Luxor she announced that Ex-President Diaz with a party of "greasy looking Mexicans" was tied up over there in a gorgeous dahabya.  He must be glad he is here instead of in his war-tossed native land.  Mr. J. P. Morgan is also tied up over there on his boat, and rumor h[as] it that the Great Man is as cross as two sticks (he may be having a left leg, also) and making the lives of his guests a burden to them. We expect to leave here March 1st for Aswan, and I presume we shall find ourselves in Cairo again about March 15th.  Mr. Rudyard Kipling [is] there now.  I hope my next communication to you will contain more thi[ngs.] 					The love I send you is endless							          Your Mim.						Friday, 21 February,1913Best Beloved -		Your letter of Jan. 29 came on Wednesday.  Jus[t] three weeks after you wrote it.  I certainly am very far away, and I sometimes get frightfully homesick for you.  I am still more or less crippled form rheumatism, and it will be two weeks tomorrow since I [had the] pleasure of riding my donkey.  It makes me chafe to think of how muc[h] I might have seen in that time, and now our days here are numbered, as we start for Aswan a week from tomorrow.  I do hope the Romeyns will get here before then, - or we may see them farther up the river.  Last Monday I left the boat for the first time in eight days and the[n] only to go across the river to see if electricity would do my aching leg any good.  Tuesday I went again for the same purpose and on my r[eturn] found Newton Byers sitting on deck talking to the Sister-Kitty!  I w[as] much more glad to see him than I’ve been before, and Wednesday afternoon I went over to the steamer Rameses III and called on his mother and sister.  His mother is just a nice, plain mother, but his sister struck me as something quite lovely and fine and rare, which opinion is cordially seconded by the carping and critical D. Newberry.[page 18; hw 33]Just as I was leaving the boat, after calling, I had the thrill of seeing no less a person than Rudyard Kipling, who was a fellow passenger of the Byers family.  Doris dined with the Byers that evening and went out to Karnak with them to see those matchless ruins by moonlight.  The Byers said D. was a perfect godsend, because until that evening their son and brother had not laughed since he left America.  He told me he didn’t want to come at all - that his family had dragged him. Yesterday I went over to lunch at the Luxor Hotel with the Contessa di Contardone di Villa Marina.  You don’t have to call her all that - just Countess or Contessa.  She is an Englishwoman who made the mistake of her life in marrying an Italian, now haply dead, leaving her a widow for the second time.  Her first husband was an Irishman named Jameson, who died while on an expedition into Central Africa with Stanley; and to hear her tell the story was a rare experience.  She is a sister of Sir Mortimer Durand who was ambassador from England to Washington some time ago.  She seems to like Doris and me as much as we do her, - though Heaven knows she can’t find us a hundredth part as interesting as we do her. 					++++++++++This is an extract form your grandmother’s last letter.  If you stopped to think for one minute how such a breaches of ordinary good manners mortify me (actually to the point of suffering) I’m sure you would not again neglect to acknowledge a present or answer an invitation.  Please write now to both Mother and Mabel.  The latter’s address is 			Mrs. H. W. Buttolph			   404 E. 12th St.			      Indianapolis	and apologize as well as you can.    Goodbye, dearest love.  I enclose a picture of the Beduin in its gala dress of flags on Lincoln’s birthday. 							Your loving 							       Mim							Luxor - 27 Feb. 1913Best Beloved -		Your letter of the 9th has just come and it made me weep - I feel so awfully about Crosson Hayes.  What a perfectly dreadful thing to have happen.  The thought of what he must have suffered made me feel so sick I didn’t want any luncheon, and I’m so low in my mind I’m afraid this wont be a cheerful letter. And now I want to explain why I’ve written so much more elaborate letters to Adeline than to you.  I knew she was going to miss me more even than you, because she lives such a shut-in life with so few distractions and almost no occupations; and so I have written those letters to her as full[y?] and as well as my very limited leisure permitted.  Then, too, I truly would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fear you wouldn’t read them.  Very few young men have the patience to read long letters.  Edward Firth told me that he sometimes carried a letter from his mother for a week in his pocket without reading it.  Of course I know you wouldn’t do that, for our relations with each other are quite [page 19; hw 34] different from those of Edward and his mother.  I’m very flattered that you "had a wonderful time" reading all that manuscript in a bunch.  I’m so very sorry you missed that lecture by Mr. Mercer, and I would love to have had you meet him.  I never knew him myself, but Ed[ward/win?] and Grace knew him, and were there part of the time with him, if I’m not mistaken.  I wish I knew whether the mines are paying and whether its Mrs. Twombly who is doing the mining now that her husband is dead.  The Milligan Mining Co. of which your uncle is President is the "Keweenaw Land Association, and I only wish I had some stock in it.  I’m still somewhat lame from my rheumatism, so that I’ve been on my donkey only once in almost three weeks.  That was last Monday and it started up the pain in my leg again so that I’ve had to forego riding since.  It makes me wild to miss so much time and lose so many opportunities, but I’m glad but it’s I and not Doris - for the years have, as the[y] ought, brought something of the philosophical mind to me, and I don’t mi[nd] it as much as she would.  She and Cousin T. rode over to the diggings this afternoon and brought back interesting news.  Harry has been excavating a palace of Rameses III and has found some very extraordinary windows (it was not supposed they had windows in that period) and also a couple of bathrooms.  I went for a long walk with a sailor to take care of me, - a little too long, for the home stretch through heavy sand was about all I could manage. Just before we arrived in Africa I said one day to Doris that I imagi[ned] we’d meet so many people we knew that the Nile would be like Chapel St.  She promptly bet me $5 that we wouldn't meet more than three sets of people that we knew.  She has lost, of course, more than twice over.  They’ve been quite thick recently.  Saturday a.m. Doris and Janet Dodg[e] cavorted about Karnak together, and in the afternoon I had the Dodge family to tea at the Winter Palace.  Sunday after church I had a litt[le] chat with Mrs. Daniel Eaton of Sachem Street.  Tuesday a.m. Mrs. Eaton came to call; Tuesday afternoon that nice Mr. Weston (you remember him first in Newport and then in Paris) turned up; and that night at the [dance] at the Winter Palace Doris bostoned most of the evening with Newton B[yers] and saw the Romeyns.  Wednesday I went over to call on the Romeyns, [and] Mrs. R. must have been really glad to see me because she kissed me.  [They] left for Aswan the next morning, but we shall see them again in Cairo if not before.  I took tea with Mr. Weston Wednesday at the W. Palace.  He asked a great deal about you and wanted me to be sure to give you his warm regards.  He has been a full-fledged Prof. at Williams for t[hree/hirty?] years now. I had already written to Manson & Co. before your letter came asking them to send you a check for $125.  If that isn’t enough to cover your Christmas expenses write me what I still owe you. We are off on Saturday for Aswan.  Up to March 20 send letters as heretofore - Shepheard’s, Cairo.  After that care Theo. M. Davis, Esq[.] Messrs. Morgan, Harjes & Co. Paris, France. Please give Crosson Hays my love and tell him it is splended to hear of courage like his. I think he is probably made of the same sort of stuff as that superb Captain Oates in the South Pole party, who after suffering for weeks without a murmur walked out into the blizzard and [page 20; hw 35] lost himself so as not to be a drag upon the rest. 		I feel almost as sorry for the unhappy fellow whose skate struck Crosson as I do for him.  It would be so hideous to carry through life the memory of havi[ng] done a thing like that even if it was utterly unavoidable.  I hope you won’t forget to tell me in your next how he is coming on.I shall have to give your love to Wadi Halfa, Sugar’s successor.  I've never set eyes on Sugar since the day long ago when I got off him bouncing and braying on an embankment and vowed I’d not ride him again. Good night, my Darling.  I do get so terribly homesick for you sometimes that I’d give all the pomp and circumstance of Egypt to be back at 615 Orange St. God bless you and keep you safe. 							Your loving 								  Mim.										    	     Aswan, 5 March, 1913Oh Gopher, I don’t know what I would not have given to have had you here today to go with us on our expedition to the Great Dam.  It surely must be one of the Wonders of the World - and what a feat of engineering!  We left Luxor Saturday the 1st and got here yesterday the 4th - 133 miles Baedeker says.  Awfully slow going, - but then we stopped twice, the first time at Edfu that Doris and I might see the temple there; and the second time at Kom Ombo for us to inspect that temple, and also because the wind was blowing so terrifically that navigation was excessively unpleasant, - so we tied up there at about one on Monday and didn’t start again until early the next (yesterday) morning.  Although we were within two minutes walk of the temple D. and I did not stir off the boat until five o’clock when the wind died down.  That Kom Ombo temple is an extraordinary one because it is duplex - one side being dedicated to a good god - the edler Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk.  I prefer the later name because it sounds like a crocodile, if said down in your throat with full value given to all the consonants.  There is one room in a little chapel on Sobk’s side which is full ofmummied [sic: of mummied] crocodiles - quite the horridest things I’ve seen in a long while.  The temple is is in a most ruinous condition, but, perhaps, all the more beautiful for that, and the situation and views are superb.  D. and I climbed up on the wreck of a splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset and indulging in a pleasant melancholy, and had it all to ourselves, except for the faithful escort, Haneen and a sailor, who dogged our feetsteps.  It really is awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here - for they are tired to death of it, having seen it so many times, and they don’t go anywhere or do anything except stay on the boat and arrange for us to see the sights.  Yesterday morning shortly after we left Kom Ombo we found a mile of flamingoes standing in ranks and files on the sandbars!We arrived here about 12:30 yesterday and it was a joyful crew that tied us up, for most of them live here.  Doris and I did the bazaar yesterday afternoon with Haneen to drive bargains for us and Amelie and a sailor in our train.  You understand that "the bazaar" in these towns means a long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs nearly meeting overhead and tiny shallow little shops like pigeonholes all along on both sides.  We thought the bazaar in Cairo enthralling, but it falls short of this one though it’s much larger.  This one so reeks of the desert and the strange things that come out of it.  You would have gone wild over the [page 21; hw 36] leopard skins and the Soudanese weapons, and the scores of things you['ve/ have?] never seen anywhere else. This morning, immediately after breakfast, D. and I, with Haneen, started for the dam - or the barrage as it’s usually called here.  Jones had engaged a carriage for us at the Cataract Hotel (opposite which we are lying with only a narrow channel between us), and had a luncheon put up for us in the native basket that looks just like the square wicker cages birds are kept in at the bird fanciers.  In less than five minutes from the time we left that very fine hotel courtyard we were in the desert - and a terrible desert, quite unlike the beautiful one at Luxor.  Ruined habitations and ruined cemeteries lay along much of the three miles we drove, and it wouldn’t have surprised me i[n] the least, though I would have been white with fear, to have seen lio[ns] stalking about in those desperate solitudes.  And then suddenly we were in the midst of an enchanting little cantonment of pretty bungalows, beautiful trees and gardens and verdant terraces, - the settlement in which live the officials and chief employees who manage the barrage.  My wildest imaginings fell far short of the stunning and bewildering reality.  Doris and I elected to walk across the barrage though most people ride on little individual skeleton cars, each one pushed by a native along a track (there are two tracks).  It is a mile and a quarter long, and there are 180 sluice gates.  On the upper side the Nile lies like a calm lake within ten feet of the top of the masonry; while on the lower side, at least a hundred feet below and about in the middle of the dam this morning where several adjoining sluices we[re] open there was a thunder and turmoil of the waters and foam almost like Niagara Falls.  At the far end of the barrage we took a felucca and sailed over to Philai, once the Island called "the Pearl of Egypt," b[ut] now so drowned by the banking up of the waters, that only the very top of the palm trees show above the water which laps the capitals of the pillars of the temple.  When we got back to the barrage we walked down four or five flights of steps along the locks and found another feluc[ca] awaiting us, which Jones had sent up, and in that we came down the ri[ver.]  We had hoped to sail, but there was such a contrary wind the men rowed the way. There are a few more sights to be seen tomorrow, and on Friday we sta[rt] on our return trip.  The air is splended here, but the wind blows too much for my complete happiness. Goodbye, darling.  God bless you and keep you safe.  I do so hope you will go to church on Easter. 							   Your Loving Mother.							Thursday, March 13, 1913							Speeding down the NileBest Beloved - 		At last we are on our homeward say.  Of course it is going to take us two months and a half to get there, but four months have gone.  We left Aswan early Friday morning and reached Lux[or] too late Sunday A.M. for D. and me to go to church.  We had expected to come down flying, having the current in our favor, as well as th[e] tug, but mad winds and many sandbars interrupted our progress.  Not that D and I minded - it was interesting to watch the crew getting us off sandbars.  We spent the rest of Sunday, and all of Monday and Tues[day] at Luxor, tied up as nearly as possible in our old place, and wit[h] nothing very exciting doing.  Doris paid one final visit to Karnak [page 22; hw 37] Sunday afternoon, and on Monday she and Cousin Theodore took their last ride on Julius Ceasar and Hermes, - while I had to do the society act for the family, going out to say goodbye to the teachers at the American mission school, and then taking a farewell tea with the Contessa.  That last was quite unnecessary because  she left Luxor just as we did, yesterday and we are all to meet in Cairo.  But the poor lady has been ill in bed and was lonely - and I always like to see her.  Tuesday Doris and Cousin Emma went over to Luxor early in the morning and I played dominoes.  Harry came over from the Valley and spent most of the day.  The diggings have stopped (this is the season for stopping them) and Harry will join us in Cairo, going down by train in about ten days when he has done the final settling up of everything in the Valley.  Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our discoveries are the only important ones made this winter at Thebes. Lancelot Crane came to tea that afternoon and he and Harry and D and I can always amuse ourselves vastly talking to each other.  Some ladies Cousin Emma knew also came.  And presently Crane and Harry mounted their donkeys and with a wave of their hats turned towards the valley.We left Luxor shortly after eleven, I think, yesterday morning and it was gectic [sic: hectic] getting off.  The sands were dotted with natives who had come to say goodbye, and get a parting backshish, and on the Luxor side, as we passed, tradesmen whom we had patronized, and many friends of the crew waved frantically at us.  We have come skimming down thus far - and oh these lovely banks!  They are covered with poppies now in long stretches.  We got to Dendereh yesterday afternoon about five and stopped for Doris and me to see that temple.  Jones said it was a very little walk.  "A little walk" in this family means not more than a ten-minute one, so we started on foot.  But it had been some years since Jones had done it and he had forgotten.  It was almost, if not quite, two miles there, which wouldn’t have mattered in the least if it hadn’t been so late.  Two sailors were sent with us, and we walked as fast as we could, but we only go there in time to see the sunset from the roof- which alone was worth the expedition, and then fairly tore through the dim recesses of the temple and down into the most amazing crypt.  It was so spooky there that it was comforting to think that the Gaffir - having seen our athletic guardians at the gates of the temple - would not dare to murder us as he so easily might.  It was a wonderful walk back - quite recompensing us for the calling down that awaited us.  The relatives had grown frightened about our being out after dark, and were cross in consequence.  Of course it was Jones who out to have been called dow [sic: down] - but considering all Jones does for us I’d always rather take a scolding than have him get one.  We started out with an escort of two sailors, and we came back with four sailors (two more having been sent out to meet us) two native men who had attached themselves to the party, two children and two goats. Your letter, undated, but postmarked Feb. 21 arrived before we left Luxor.  I am so glad to hear Crossen Hays has come out so well from that dreadful catastrophe.  I wish I knew where you were to spend the [page 23; hw 38] Easter Holidays, and I wish - more than I have words to tell, that you were going to spend them with me.  Please let me know as soon as you have any definite idea of what you are going to do in the summer. I must write and ask MacShurry if he means to keep the apartment on till fall, for if he does, Doris and I will have to go to the York hall or some such place during the three weeks of June that we shall spend in New Haven. Once more Roger dear I want to beg you to go see Kim some Sunday.  I love that little dog almost as if he were human, and I really can['t] bear to think that a member of his own family is in the same town a[ll] these months without ever going to see him.  Dr. Nolte is the name [and] you can find the address in the telephone book. More love than could be written and God bless my boy. 						Your loving				    		    Mother						Cairo - Saturday - 23 Mch 1913Best Beloved - 		Here we are again, having finished the voyage down the river Thursday morning.  Said voyage was more or le[ss] spoiled by the incessant winds which made sitting on deck disagreea[ble] and uncomfortable; and sitting on deck is the main point to a trip on the Nile.  Our running onto the numerous sandbars which now impe[de] navigation in the present low state of the river Doris and I regard was interesting.  It was so amusing watching the men get us off.  Wednesday morning we sat on a sandbar for an hour in company with 2 large steamers, i [sic: 1] small steamer and 27 native boats! We are to stay on the boat until a week from today when we move to Ghezireh Palace.  This may sound as though we were to visit the Khedive, but it’s merely an hotel where a Khedivial palace used to [be] and which is run by the same management as Shepheard’s.  Being on a[n] island in the river it is pleasanter at this time of year than Shepheard’s.Yesterday, being Good Friday, I went to church.  Doris didn’t feel well so I went alone in the huge red motor car.  The church was ful[l] and many, many men were there.  That’s one of the fine things about Englishmen - they stand steadfastly by the training of their youth in the matter of churchgoing.  Coming out I stopped for a moment to look at the plain little tablet set in the hall at the end of the church in memory of that great hero Gordon.  Outside the door I found Mrs. Romeyn and Emma waiting for me. Your letter of the 6th has just come and I’m cutting this short in order to catch tonight’s mail and let you know at once our plans a[s soon] as I know them.  I can’t understand how I’ve failed to do it before.  We sail from Alexandria April 9th, arrive in Florence probably the [? and] stay about a week there, then go to Venice for about a week; then [page 24; hw 39] London about the 1st of May, and sail for home May 21st.  Our address from now on is 		Care Theo. M. Davis, Esq.			Messrs. Morgan, Hayes & Co.				ParisWill write again very soon.  Oceans of love from						Mother				Ghezireh Palace - Sunday, 30 March        				1913       CairoBest Beloved - 		As Doris wrote you early in the week I postponed my writing.  We moved to this hotel Friday and were glad to get away from the dahabya on account of the heat which was growing too great on the river.  It’s much cooler here.  The rooms are perfectly gigantic - truly palatial.  There’s a nice garden to walk or sit in.  But I have a confused feeling, - my room is so big I can’t find any of my things without hunting all over the place.  I feel that we are wasting opportunities here but we can’t help ourselves.  I’ve done only two things worth doing since last Sunday.  One of them was the Torchlight Tattoo Tuesday evening on Kasr el Nil Barracks Ground.  It was a very fine spectacle, - quite thrilling to see issuing forth from a great doorway two hundred Gordon Highlanders each carrying a torch.  They marched and evoluted in lines of light; and finally took their stand outlining three sides of a tremendous hollow square in which all the performances took place.The other worth-while incident of the week was spending a couple of hours in the museum Wednesday morning and seeing the wonders there in the new light of my recently acquired learning in Egyptology.  For the rest I’ve gone to dressmakers and done errands, and taken little drives to nowhere and played many games of dominoes.  This morning Harry Burton and I went to church while Doris staid on duty, and this afternoon I staid while Doris and Harry went to the Zoo.  They had a fascinating time and saw many enchanting sites - baby lions and baby giraffes and a hippo that came when it was called and opened and shut, at the bidding of its keeper, the cavern it calls its mouth; and a baby elephant marching at the head of a company of Scotch pipers; and they had their tea on a tiny island in a little lake where they were surrounded by pelicans and flamingoes. Tomorrow we go to Sakkara on camels - a 16 mile ride in all.  I’m doing it out of pure bravado because Doris thinks I can’t.  "Mother you’re crazy! And Roger wouldn’t allow it for a minute if he were here."  But you are not here, are you darling?  Alas! that you are not!  And I know you like your mother to be a true sport.  Harry and Doris and I and a Lady Hilda something to whom we have talked several times, and who is who is [sic] cutting all kinds of engagements tomorrow to go with us. Goodnight my own dear boy.  God bless you and keep you safe.							Your loving								     Mother[page 25; hw 40] We’ve had to make some plans for the summer - though they can be bro[ken] if they do not prove best.  Doris wants very much to go to Castine.  I’ve written to engage three rooms there.  But what I do when summer really comes depends mainly on what you do.  Only one must have an anchor to windward. 							M.								Sunday 6 April, 1913								Ghezireh PalaceBest Beloved - 		Jones has just informed me that unless I get my letters off at 2:30 this afternoon they won’t go for three days.  It is now 12:30 and luncheon in half an hour.  So this must be dashed off at a gallop.  Oh my dear! that camel expedition on Monday was the most wonderful thing I ever did.  Of course I was horribly lame for 2 days afterwards, but so were Harry and Doris.  Y[ou] would have adored it, - I’d have given anything to have had you alon[g.]  They weren’t awfully good camels either, so I can imagine the raptur[e] of riding fine ones.  Harry went off the other day on an expedition with some English people one of whom was the Major of a Highland regiment.  Said Major furnished the camels from the coastguard corps and Harry said they were perfectly superb, and much much easier to r[ide] than the ones we had. We’ve haunted bazaars and done errands and had some swagger clothes made (for which your uncle insisted on paying; - but we wouldn’t hav[e] had them otherwise), and had visitors and gone to teas, and revelled in street sights, and I’ve seen the Khedive and almost seen Lord Kitchener but not quite, and have met one of the highest-up men in t[he] Army here - Major Watson, or Watson Pasha - whichever you choose to call him, who is aide-de-camp to the Khedive.  He is an enchanting person and if he weren’t already married I should try to get him for Little Sister. We are sailing Wednesday so my next letter will be from Naples where we expect to spend two days, going thence to Florence.  No letter from you since 2 weeks ago.  Hope all goes well with you. Endless love from 								Your Mim											The Mediterranean - 10 April,  ll[l?]							Dampfer "Prinz Heinrich"Best Beloved. 	We left Cairo yesterday morning at 9:45 and reached Alexandria at one after a comfortable trip through such lovely scenes I couldn’t bear to take my eyes off the windows for a minute.  We sailed at 2:30 and are due in Naples at 11 A.M. Saturday.  If we are not late and if the day is pleasant (it’s funny I remembered to say that after four months of pleasant days as a matter of course) Harry is going to take Doris - and me if I can get off - to Pompeii.  And Sunday Cousin T. is planning to take us on a marvellous motor trip al[ong] [page 26; hw 41] the coast of Amalfi.  Monday we shall probably proceed upon our way to Florence.  Before leaving Cairo we managed to work in a little more sightseeing.  We saw a mosque - the second largest in the world, and quite beautiful.  It contains two objects of particular interest - a granite column that came there all by itself from Mecca, and a magic stone which when people have violent tummy aches they go and lick until their tongues bleed.  Quite a deep hollow had been licked in it, and the blood stains on the base were very revolting.  We also went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which form a sort of Stately City of the Dead with superb domes and exquisite minarets, on which the outskirts of the City proper and close to the desert.  Doris and I would have given our eyeteeth for one untrammeled week in Cairo.  There are such wonderful things to see and do there and we missed so many of them through no fault of ours. I do so hope to find a letter from you in Naples forwarded from Paris.  It seems very long since I heard. 					Your loving, loving Mim.											Grande Bretagne       					Florence						18 April, 1913Best Beloved - 		We are feeling so terribly over the news of Charlotte Walcott’s death which we just heard yesterday.  I have that most desperate of all feelings - the belief that somehow it might have been prevented.  This is no reflection on his father, who could not drop everything and go with him to California.  But if he had had a mother or his sister to go with him we [sic: he] would not have been subjected for so long to what Mr. Walcott himself wrote me was "the wrong treatment."  The one ray of comfort in the whole tragedy is that he is now with his mother. I got your letter of Zarch [sic: March] 20th the other day in Naples, just after I had posted mine to you.  And your April 1st one reached me here yesterday.  We had to waste one day in Naples as it rained so torrentially, and practically the sole fruit of our stay there was that Doris saw Pompeii - which was one of her heart’s desires.  I would have liked to see it too, for in the 30 years which have elapsed since I was there much has been excavated.  But it wasn’t possible for us both to do it, and I was crazy to have D. go. 	We got here Tuesday night, having left Naples at 9:45 that morning, with Vesuvius covered a third of the way down from its summit with snow.  The cold and the rain here in Italy have been hard to bear after the sunlight and warmth of Egypt.  But it is such an entrancing trip here from Naples - such verdant count[ry?,] such beautiful vineyards, such a riot of flowers, the mountains and hills so splended and so romantic with the feudal towns crowning the summits of the foothills and long, long roads leading up to them.  On the enclosed card I’ve marked about where our sitting room windows are, and the bridge you see is the far famed Ponte Vecchio, lined on both sides with the most enthralling shops.  Near the bridge this side of the Ponte Vecchio, and which just misses getting into the picture, someone was committing suicide as we drove up to the hotel the night of our arrival. [page 27; hw 42]Cousin T. has chartered a motor car and it’s on tap all day.  He loves to take long drives, and he has already taken us on some marvellous ones.  The mountain roads about here are something wonderful.  In between times we dash to picture galleries and churches, and hau[?] little shops under the guidance of Harry Burton who is a perfect trump.  Cousin Emma’s nieces (who are my cousins) Nettie and Mary Buttles, who live here in Florence, are like the motor car - always on tap.  And they are so delightful, that the critical D pronounces them "the nicest cousins she has ever seen."  Elsie Olyphant is here looking fine, and she and D. have had one afternoon together already.  The Beebes will be in town in a day or two.  It is an absolutely fascinating place, with such a bewildering number of things to do a[nd] see one would have to spend many winters here to do it justice. In one of your letters you say "owing to the fact that my clothes supply was very limited."  If you haven’t clothes enough you must g[et] enough.  It seems to me that you ought to be able to buy them out of your allowance but if you are not I’ll pay for them gladly.  I’m so delighted that you were going to see Kim.  And Gopher dearest, have you written to your grandmother and Aunt Mabel?  I can hardly belie[ve] that after all I said about it you have still neglected it, but I’m a little nervous because Grandmother has not mentioned hearing from [you.]  I beg that you will do it without any further delay, if by any chan[ce] it is still undone.  Don’t think it is a small matter.  It is not t[oo] small in itself to be important.  And because I ask you to do it ou[ght] to be - to you - an impelling reason.  Your Aunt’s address is:I’m delighted you had such a nice time with Andrew, and I’m fonder [than] ever of him just because he was good to you.  Your enthusiasm over James Kemp makes me think he must have improved very much since I k[new] him thirty years ago - which, of course, is time enough for anyone to improve. Now I must bid you goodnight with a tight hug.						Your loving 							Mother						May 2, 1913							     Buckland’s Hotel 							     Brook Street							     Grosvenor Square, Darling Gopher 	This letter is somewhat belated and I’m sorry.  We left Florence Monday afternoon, April 28th at five in the afterno[on] and reached here Tuesday night at quarter of eleven; and dearly as I love England I am now getting so impatient to be home that I have a constant pushing feeling inside myself.  On the Sunday before lea[v]ing Florence I went to the American Church and encountered the Romey[ns] and we walked home together.  D. and I also ran across them the next morning when we were paying a final visit to the beauties contained in the church of Santa Croce.  Mrs. Romeyn was full of Rad’s nobili[ty] in sticking to his job instead of accepting her invitation for him [to] come to Europe for the summer.[page 28; hw 43]Mr. R. observed that Radcliffe was not fond of Europe!  "But he is fond of his family" I said.  "Oh! he likes his mother" said Mr. R. - "but not me!"  I never have been able to make Mr. R. out!  We saw Helen Walcott again, - she came to see us; and I had from Mr. Walcott one of the most desperately pathetic letters I ever read.  The sense of Charlie’s loss grows continually greater with me, and the rose color has faded out of everything.  One of the very first things I meant to do on getting home was to go to see him, and it makes my heart heavy to think that the utmost I can ever do now is to go and put some flowers on his grave. As in Italy so also here - we motor and motor and motor.  It’s fortunate that both D. and I are so fond of it.  Here we have one of the finest cars I’ve ever ridden in; - but it’s always a limosine which destroys some of the pleasure.  Today we’ve been to St. Albans - a magnificent cathedral, the largest, I’m told, in England, and built on the site where the first martyrdom to Christianity took place in England.  As Cousin T. was waiting for us outside we didn’t half see it, but the drive there and back was lovely.I got your letter, telling of your visit to Kim and that you thought of going to Sonopah with Fred Brown, just before leaving Florence.  Would that I, too, might go to Sonopah.The Bakers seem to have been very kind about inviting you to meals.  I hope you have called spontaneously at least once.  If not please do it before we get home.  I don’t want my rapture at being with you once again marred by finding you’ve been rude to people who have been kind to you.  Also it will be more in keeping with your self respect to go by yourself than to be dragged there by the seat of your trou by an irate Mim.  Oh Dearest how good it will be to see you again!						God keep you safe.							Your loving Mim.						     Monday, May 12, 1913Best Beloved - 		Since my last letter I’ve been so unhappy I just couldn’t bring myself to write.  It is nothing that has happened to any of this party, and it’s nothing that I feel like writing about; though I’ll tell you the whole story when I get home.  O blessed word - Home!  But the thing has been so constantly in my mind that I’ve not been able to enjoy anything. I dined with Mrs. Bonbright the other evening at Claridges.  She and Mr. B. live over here most of the time now, and have a place in the country.  They were staying in town for a few days preparatory to sailing for America (which they did on Saturday) for Howard’s wedding!  He is marrying a Detroit girl named Elizabeth Hodges, and if she is as lovely as her picture she must be a Queen indeed.  We are invited to tea on Wednesday to meet Norman Sturgis and his wife! - or rather [page 29; hw 44] they are asked to meet us.  The Luckrafts are in town and being awfully nice to us, and so is Lily Solly.  Mrs. Bell is still in America.  We’ve done a lot of motoring through this lovely English country.  It’s a heavenly time of year to be here, but the weather has been horrid.  We motored to Oxford yesterday and on our way back stopped at Stoke Poges, where Wm. Penn was born, and saw the exquis[ite] and very cheerful churchyard where Grey wrote his Elegy.  We also came through Eton and saw scores of Eton boys in their silk hats.  Their ends didn’t correspond - for almost all of them wore slovenly unpolished shoes. D. and I have been to three picture galleries and have seen such hauntingly lovely things that if it weren’t for my darling son and [my] hankering to see him, I’d like to stay here another month just to look at pictures.  I must have told you - though I can’t remember - that D and I are going to the York-hall, as I suppose the MacSherry[s] are still at 615, and I hope they’ll stay there all summer. I’ll probably write you one more little note before we sail.  Don’t forget date and steamer - May 21, Kronprinz Wilhelm.  We ought to l[and] on the 28th.  Of course I don’t know whether or not you were planni[ng] to meet us, or would be able to.  But I’m going to say "Don’t".  Every extra person only adds to poor Cousin T’s confusion of mind, [so?] we’ll take the first train we can for New Haven.  I’ll telegraph yo[u] the minute we land. I’ve had so much to trouble me recently, and I feel so piffliss, I don’t want any flaw in my homecoming.  So if you love your Mim you’[ll] be sure to have done the things I’ve made a point of your doing (ca[ll]ing on the Bakers, and writing those letters) before I get there. Goodnight and a million blessings on your dear head.  My love to Jack and to Wilson. 						Your loving Mother.								May 16, 1913						Best Beloved- 	I learn that the MacSherrys have left 615 Orange.  So Doris and I can go there instead of to the York Hall.  I also learn that the Kronprinz Wilhelm ought to reach N.Y. the morning of Tuesday May 27.  Hurrah!!						      Best Love							     Your Mother. 							Tuesday, 24 June							On the train from Newport							to New Haven.Best Beloved -			I’m on my way home again, and this, I think, ends Newp[ort] for me till autumn.  I think I never felt much lonelier in my life than Saturday night with the feeling that every minute was taking [you] farther away from me.  And I know you felt with me the added woe of the loss of the game.  Fate certainly rubbed it into us this ti[me.]  It was hard to leave Cousin Theodore - he so hated to see me go. [He] [page 30] offered me the gardener’s cottage for the summer!  Even the presence of Cecile who arrived last evening with Terry, did not seem to console him for my departure.  H [sic: He] looked so shocking this morning it sent my heart into my mouth.I’m afraid it’s going to be horribly hot in New Haven, but with escape before me I suppose I can stand it.  I’m longing for your first letter.  Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris and tell her how much I appreciate her hospitality to you. 					God bless my boy.							Your loving							        Mim.						615 Orange Street						New Haven 						30 June, 1913Best Beloved - 		It was a joyful surprise to get your letter from Kansas City, and I hope mine to you from Newport reached you before you left Denver for Leadville.  	I got back from Newport last Tuesday and on Friday went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to spend the last night with the Taylors.  I had positively promised them a visit so I had to go.  Henry Devereux was there and we had a nice old fashioned Colorado time, and the next day they motored me all the way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the Lawn Club before they returned to The Hill. Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she would wire me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has come, and I’m so anxious I’ve telegraphed Mrs. Balter to ask if they got there.  Nan Hart has sent me an enlargement of that lovely picture of D. on horseback with the mountains behind her.  It’s a perfect beauty and I’m so pleased.  I went out to see Kim this afternoon and he, too, was a vision of beauty in my eyes.  He had just been bathed and he was a reddish fluff.  He almost ate me up, talking hysterically until he was exhausted and flopped flat on his little tummy on the floor, thumping his tail and rolling the whites of his eyes at me.  If he we find the boarding home at Castine will let us have him we are going to have him sent up. I hope to get off on Wednesday stopping two days at Springfield (or rather Blandford near there) with Paige.  My accommodations on the boat from Boston are engaged for the night of the 4th.  Castin, Maine will be our simple address.  When you write tell me every detail - nothing will be too small to interest me.  I do hope you’ll like it. Uncle Frank and Aunt Lida want you to stop and make them a visit in Denver on your way home in case they are back there from the East. I paid the bill at once. God bless my boy and keep him safe.						Your loving Mim[page 31; hw 52]again and spend a week or ten days.  Emily is arriving from the ot[her] side tomorrow, but she has to go back again in November to spend th[e] winter with Julia. Your letter telling of all your Colorado Springs doings and the peo[ple] you had seen was most interesting.  It was revealed to me in a flas[h] of lightening (truly) during a ferocious and appalling storm one night that I had wholly forgotten to charge you to hunt up Maggie i[n] Colo. Springs.  Hence my costly wire. My head is feeling so queer I think I must put it to bed.  I’m much too old and too important to work the way I do.  Please hurry up an[d] be a mining King so that I may be surrounded by vassals and serfs, [as] well as covered with ropes of pearls.Doris is having a violent attach of rheumatism in Castine.  The Bak[ers?] are taking care of her like the dears they are.  I think I’m going [to] start for Gambier Monday, so send your next letter there.  And you descending on Mrs. Morris again!  How good people have been to you.  Hospitality is the Crown of Glory of the West - my beloved West.  I think Frank & Lida are in Denver by now.  Be sure to find out.  And [I'd] like to have you call on the Stimsons too.Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris and tell her I don’t know how to thank her for all she and hers have done for you. God bless my boy,       Your loving Mummy,              615 Orange St.       New Haven        14 SeptemberBest Beloved - 		Something so dreadful has happened - I can[not] bear to tell you.  Jones, dear Jones killed himself four nights ago [at] The Reef.  He had been having trouble with his head and must gav [?sic: have] gone crazy for the time.  He shot himself in the hall outside of hi[s room] and the servants found him in the early morning.  I think it would [have] killed Cousin Theodore too had he known the whole truth.  But they [told] him Jones was very ill and had gone home, and then next day they tol[d] him there was no hope, - and then that he was dead.  I have few fri[ends] anywhere that I would mourn for more.  You have no idea the things [he] did for me last winter - nobody ever in my life took care of me lik[e] that, - and always begging to be allowed to do more.  And in all my [life?] I have known few men as worthy of admiration and affection as Jones. It seems a long time since I heard from you.  I hope nothing is the matter.  I have postponed going to Ohio till October. 								Endless love, Mother. 									The Reef									Newport, R.I. Oct. 14, 1[913]Best Beloved - There is nothing to write about here, but I’m afraid [I] won’t get any letters from you unless I send an occasional one to y[ou] and letters to me now are food to the starving.  The weather has be[en? ?] [page 32; hw 53] and is simply hideous, so that your Uncle is housebound and we play cards and dominoes from morning till night, never stopping in the evening until eleven P.M.  The one that keeps me from going crazy is that I sleep at night as though I had been clubbed. I had a note from Mrs. Luckraft yesterday in which she said: "Isabel will undoubtedly write me how fascinating Roger is that you and Doris love him so."Please take pity on your loving Mim and write to her. 							The Reef							Newport, R.I.							16 October, 1913Best Beloved -	I regret to say that the pin forBob [sic: for Bob] Campbell is in my safety deposit box at the bank and that I cannot put my hand on the key.  You’ll just have to tell him about it, and send it to him later unless the enclosed permit works.  It is possible the men at the bank can open my box (it’s a new one in their new vaults) without my key.  I think there are two stickpins.  The one for Bob is the greeny-blue one, not the yellow one. Life drags on here in clouds and rain and gloom.  I love you very much and hope you are well and happy. 	Your loving		Mim. 							Sunday Night, Oct. 28, 1913							Hotel St. Regis							New YorkBest Beloved - 		This is just to tell you how dear you were on Sunday.  Doris spoke of it, too.  You made your house very happy.  If you can possibly manage to get two more tickets to the Princeton game (for which I will pay) I can secure a young man to take Isabel and then I can go with you.  Said young man is Chilton Powell, a sort of cousin of mine, an instructor at Columbia, and an awfully nice fellow.  He was dining here last night and I sounded him about the game, in case I could get tickets, and he’ll be tickled to death to come.  Please let me know (Gambier) as soon as you can, what the prospects are so that I can let him know officially. 									Best love, darling, from							Your Mim.								Gambier, Ohio								Sunday, 2 Nov. 1913Best Beloved - 		Yesterday in Cleveland Mr. and Mrs. Eells spent an hour trying to make me say that I would go to Egypt with them.  I finally agreed to let them know as soon as I could hear from you.  I did not tell them that I would go if you were willing; but I did say that it was matters in connection with you that stood in the way of my accepting their invitation.  If you are willing I would like to go.  If you are not willing I do not want to go.  The reason why I do not

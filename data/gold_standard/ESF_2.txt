Darling Gopher -     	This voyage is almost over; - We are due in Na[?] in the morning at the crude hour of six, though we don’t have to ge[t?] until considerably later.  But, presumably, there will be bumpings bangings and yellings from five on so that sleep will be wooed in v[ain.]  The voyage has been a good one as voyages go.  This steamer is very [?] and most remarkably steady; the service is excellent, willing and m[ost] courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if y[ou] were so disposed.  The menus have included everything the plain Amer[ican] has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never heard [of?] from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dilled cucumber."

After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we retu[rned] to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with baskets of fru[it], boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves.  One wondrous basket was from Nelso[n] and Wallace, and a box of chrysanthemums as big as cabbages with ste[ms] a yard long was from                        	.  We were an hour late i[n] sailing and didn’t start till twelve.

Our one disappointment was the thick weather which prevented our hav[ing] anything more than very unsatisfactory glimpses of the Azores.  But Oh! Gibraltar!  The Sister-Kitty says she has written you all about [it?] but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you a more than faint id[ea] of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of that wonderful spot.  We did so hanker for you, - and Jones was the first to say it aloud, how much he wished you were there.

Yesterday our first day in the Mediterranean was perfectly beautiful [with?] a smooth pale blue sea, and the splendid almost sinister coast of Af[rica] very near, with mountains so high there was snow upon their summits.  [It?] was after dark when we anchored before Algiers last evening and Cous[in] Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peer-less Jones.  "They are everyone of them beasts in that town" he said shortly, "There’s no knowing what they might say to you".  "Not with me there, sir," said Jones.  But he wouldn’t let us go.  However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in [the] moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely packed buildings [ris?]ing to the crest of the hill was a lovely spectacle from the deck of [the] ship.  Today the Mediterranean has been too choppy for perfect beauty but we’ve had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky mount[ain] ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits.  Baedeker says briefly that "public safely is not guaranteed to travellers in Sardinia."

Dear Cousin T. remarks at intervals what a fine fellow you are, and painstakingly explains again and again how it happened that he did not recognize you.  He is perfectly devoted to Doris and I am tickled almost to death.  He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he’d have a charming time.  "I’ve sometimes had such dreadful people", he added!

I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy.  Please do if you possibly can, Dearest.  I’m so afraid the memory of this family may grow dim if he doesn’t see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that. 

Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells?  For D. a check for 250 francs to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.

Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I’m wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you.  My love to Jack and Wilson Foss.  Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear head.

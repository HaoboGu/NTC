Best Beloved - 		Here we are again, having finished the voyage down the river Thursday morning.  Said voyage was more or le[ss] spoiled by the incessant winds which made sitting on deck disagreea[ble] and uncomfortable; and sitting on deck is the main point to a trip on the Nile.  Our running onto the numerous sandbars which now impe[de] navigation in the present low state of the river Doris and I regard was interesting.  It was so amusing watching the men get us off.  Wednesday morning we sat on a sandbar for an hour in company with 2 large steamers, i [sic: 1] small steamer and 27 native boats! 

We are to stay on the boat until a week from today when we move to Ghezireh Palace.  This may sound as though we were to visit the Khedive, but it’s merely an hotel where a Khedivial palace used to [be] and which is run by the same management as Shepheard’s.  Being on a[n] island in the river it is pleasanter at this time of year than Shepheard’s.

Yesterday, being Good Friday, I went to church.  Doris didn’t feel well so I went alone in the huge red motor car.  The church was ful[l] and many, many men were there.  That’s one of the fine things about Englishmen - they stand steadfastly by the training of their youth in the matter of churchgoing.  Coming out I stopped for a moment to look at the plain little tablet set in the hall at the end of the church in memory of that great hero Gordon.  Outside the door I found Mrs. Romeyn and Emma waiting for me. 

Your letter of the 6th has just come and I’m cutting this short in order to catch tonight’s mail and let you know at once our plans a[s soon] as I know them.  I can’t understand how I’ve failed to do it before.  We sail from Alexandria April 9th, arrive in Florence probably the [? and] stay about a week there, then go to Venice for about a week; then [page 24; hw 39] 
London about the 1st of May, and sail for home May 21st.  Our address from now on is 
		Care Theo. M. Davis, Esq.

Will write again very soon.  Oceans of love from

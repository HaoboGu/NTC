Happy New Year, Best Beloved.		I got up early so as to make my greeting to you the first one I either uttered or wrote.  And I wrote it just in time, for in another two minutes Amelie came in with my orange juice,- which is my waking ceremony every morning. 

The principal thing that has occurred since my last week’s letter to you was our visit to the Valley.  We all went out last Friday, Doris, Cousin T. and Jones riding, and Cousin E and I driving.  It’s seven miles.  I meant to ride also, but I found Cousin Emma hated to drive [page 11; hw 26] alone so I went with her.  Our vehicle was a sort of surrey thing draw[n] by two mules and driven by a pirate in baggy white "trou."  When we finally entered the Valley my breath was taken away.  It was like driving on a very good, glaring white road through the wreck of the world.  Absolutely the desert, not a suggestion of a growing thing anywhere.  Towering cliffs all about us, wild masses of rock hurled everywhere, l[ife?]less stretches of broken fragments of flint and limestone and fossiliz[ed] shells, the blazing sun, the splendid cloudless sky.  The house is in what is called the West Valley, which, though it contains two or three tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs, being divided from that by a ridge.  The house is long, low (one storied) flat-roofed, made of roug[h] stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican houses.  It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cliffs directly behind it and a stone’s throw across the road in front of it another ridge dividing it from a third valley.  The bedrooms are like cells with little s[lits?] of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls.  The sitting room is ba[re?] and mannish and the dining room ditto, - but all very neat.  Harry Bur[ton] is a delightfully orderly person.  You know he is managing your uncle’[s] excavations and so lives out there in the house.  All the water used t[oo/here?] is brought miles in jars on donkeyback - as it was in Ecuador. Threr [sic: There] [is?] an excellent cook, and a houseboy and two guards.  A guard armed with [a] rifle stands at the front corner of the house all night. 

Saturday morning we all proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin T[.] mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair carrie[d] by two men and D. & I on foot.  It was a sensation of a lifetime to visit that place for the first time.  A number of tombs are open to th[e] public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his des[ire.?]  But Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the valley, it was amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gaping tourists and disapp[ear] into an opening labelled "No Admittance" from which were issuing clouds of dust and a procession of children carrying dirt and rocks in baskets which they emptied on a dump.  Most of the manual labor in excavations in this region is done by children and I hate it.  They are urged on b[y] overseers with whips.  But our overseer was deprived of his whip last year when Harry saw him cut a piece out of a boy’s leg with the lash. 

Time fails to tell you of the marvels of the tombs we saw.That afternoon I took a walk alone and climbed a ridge and went down into another valley and up on the ridge beyond.  And the sun went down, and without sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saw.  The silence was dr[ead]ful, and I was suddenly siezed with a horror of the desert and fled ba[ck] to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off  by myself.  Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our tooties explore[d] the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why all the kings didn’t make their tombs there I cannot understand.  It is the most regal, stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saw. 

Cousin Emma and I came home to the Dahabya Monday morning and glad enough we were to get here.  But Cousin Theodore and Doris tarried til[l] yesterday.  He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it.  But it would get on [my] nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations and were really living there. 
[page 12; hw 27]
We had a wonderful mail today, but no letter from you.  We had a wonderful ride this afternoon, Cousin T., D. & I. over to Medinet Habu, near the foot of the mountains, where there are the most beautiful ruins we’ve seen yet.

Goodnight, Darling, and God bless my boy.
						Your Loving

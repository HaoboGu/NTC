Best Beloved - 		It was a joyful surprise to get your letter from Kansas City, and I hope mine to you from Newport reached you before you left Denver for Leadville.  	I got back from Newport last Tuesday and on Friday went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to spend the last night with the Taylors.  I had positively promised them a visit so I had to go.  Henry Devereux was there and we had a nice old fashioned Colorado time, and the next day they motored me all the way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the Lawn Club before they returned to The Hill. 

Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she would wire me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has come, and I’m so anxious I’ve telegraphed Mrs. Balter to ask if they got there.  Nan Hart has sent me an enlargement of that lovely picture of D. on horseback with the mountains behind her.  It’s a perfect beauty and I’m so pleased.  I went out to see Kim this afternoon and he, too, was a vision of beauty in my eyes.  He had just been bathed and he was a reddish fluff.  He almost ate me up, talking hysterically until he was exhausted and flopped flat on his little tummy on the floor, thumping his tail and rolling the whites of his eyes at me.  If he we find the boarding home at Castine will let us have him we are going to have him sent up. 

I hope to get off on Wednesday stopping two days at Springfield (or rather Blandford near there) with Paige.  My accommodations on the boat from Boston are engaged for the night of the 4th.  Castin, Maine will be our simple address.  When you write tell me every detail - nothing will be too small to interest me.  I do hope you’ll like it. 

Uncle Frank and Aunt Lida want you to stop and make them a visit in Denver on your way home in case they are back there from the East. 

I paid the bill at once. God bless my boy and keep him safe.

again and spend a week or ten days.  Emily is arriving from the ot[her] side tomorrow, but she has to go back again in November to spend th[e] winter with Julia. 

Your letter telling of all your Colorado Springs doings and the peo[ple] you had seen was most interesting.  It was revealed to me in a flas[h] of lightening (truly) during a ferocious and appalling storm one night that I had wholly forgotten to charge you to hunt up Maggie i[n] Colo. Springs.  Hence my costly wire. 

My head is feeling so queer I think I must put it to bed.  I’m much too old and too important to work the way I do.  Please hurry up an[d] be a mining King so that I may be surrounded by vassals and serfs, [as] well as covered with ropes of pearls.

Doris is having a violent attach of rheumatism in Castine.  The Bak[ers?] are taking care of her like the dears they are.  I think I’m going [to] start for Gambier Monday, so send your next letter there.  And you descending on Mrs. Morris again!  How good people have been to you.  Hospitality is the Crown of Glory of the West - my beloved West.  I think Frank & Lida are in Denver by now.  Be sure to find out.  And [I'd] like to have you call on the Stimsons too.

Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris and tell her I don’t know how to thank her for all she and hers have done for you. 
God bless my boy,
       Your loving Mummy,

Best Beloved - 		Something so dreadful has happened - I can[not] bear to tell you.  Jones, dear Jones killed himself four nights ago [at] The Reef.  He had been having trouble with his head and must gav [?sic: have] gone crazy for the time.  He shot himself in the hall outside of hi[s room] and the servants found him in the early morning.  I think it would [have] killed Cousin Theodore too had he known the whole truth.  But they [told] him Jones was very ill and had gone home, and then next day they tol[d] him there was no hope, - and then that he was dead.  I have few fri[ends] anywhere that I would mourn for more.  You have no idea the things [he] did for me last winter - nobody ever in my life took care of me lik[e] that, - and always begging to be allowed to do more.  And in all my [life?] I have known few men as worthy of admiration and affection as Jones. 

It seems a long time since I heard from you.  I hope nothing is the matter.  I have postponed going to Ohio till October. 
								Endless love, Mother.

Best Beloved - There is nothing to write about here, but I’m afraid [I] won’t get any letters from you unless I send an occasional one to y[ou] and letters to me now are food to the starving.  The weather has be[en? ?] [page 32; hw 53] and is simply hideous, so that your Uncle is housebound and we play cards and dominoes from morning till night, never stopping in the evening until eleven P.M.  The one that keeps me from going crazy is that I sleep at night as though I had been clubbed. 

I had a note from Mrs. Luckraft yesterday in which she said: "Isabel will undoubtedly write me how fascinating Roger is that you and Doris love him so."

Please take pity on your loving Mim and write to her.

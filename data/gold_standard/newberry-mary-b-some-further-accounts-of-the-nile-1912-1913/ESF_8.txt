Darling Gopher - 	The nicest things that happened to me today were receipt of your letter of Dec. 7, and the fact that Emily Morgan spent a little part of the day with us.  Those two things kept me from wholly succumbing to homesickness.  I felt its touch on my shoulder, so to spe[ak] all day long.  The Serapis and Mr. Tuck and his party, of which Emily and Miss Nelson are two-ninths, came down from Aswan yesterday.  They waved from the deck as they steamed by us, and soon after luncheon we went ov[er] to the Serapis to call.  Emily is certainly one of the sweetest things [in?] all the world.  I was as glad to see her as if she were my very own. 

I hung up my stocking as I’ve never missed doing, but the Sister-Kittie refused to indulge in what she seemed to consider an empty form without a chimney piece to hang them by.  Cousin Theodore gave us his presents in Cairo - a pearl and diamond ring to Doris, and a stunning gold mesh purse to me.  Doris gave me a beautiful red linen cover with embroidery for my table; Cousin Emma gave me an inlaid sandalwood box, Dick Baker gave me another one.  (Doris was his agent).  The Mitchell ladies, Mrs Hoppin and Aunt Mabel had all sent me packages to bring ov[er] with me.  Jones gave Doris and me each a little silver seal with our initials in Arabic engraved on it.  We were much touched by this gift.  And Mohammed Muhassef, the best known and most reliable antiquity deal[er] here, sent D. & me each a scarab.  Cousin T. has had many dealins [sic: dealings] with [him] so every Christmas he sends a present to each member of Cousin T’s par[ty.]  After the breakfast things were cleared from the table, the ceremony of giving the crew their presents took place.  Cousin T. & Cousin E. sat [at] the table, D. & I on the divan, and Jones was master of ceremonies.  T[he] crew and inside servants came in one by one, kissed our hands, said "Kulle sana w’inta taiyih" (A Happy New Year to you), and each receiv[ed] a white shawl, a box of cigarettes, a bag with candy and nuts, and some money, and departed beaming.  When they all had had their presents the[y] gathered on the deck and shouted "Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooray!  T’ank you, t’ank you, t’ank you", and we retired to our several apartments and washed our hands in dioxygen.

[T]hen the felucca took Doris and me across the river, and Harry Burton [m]et us at the steps (he is stopping at the Winter Palace, there being no [r]oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church which [i]s away at the rear of a garden filled with palms and acacias and other [l]ovely things, and where an Arab was ringing the bell outside, as they did [i?]n "Bunty".  And Emily joined us inside.  It was very comforting to me [t]o have her go to church with us this far land on this Day of Days.  [W]hen we came back to the Beduin we brought Harry and Mr. Crane (a young [E]nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crane) to luncheon.  [A]fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymkana in the Winter Palace [g]ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for tea so we couldn’t.  The [T]ucks came and Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were [c]razy about the boat, and we had a lovely time.  They go on their way to Cairo tomorrow at one. 		We had such a perfectly enormous [d]inner tonight with only the four of us to eat it that by the time the turkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, and have it carried off unscathed, for we had to eat plum pudding.  Jones having heard me remark that I was going to break over my total abstinence on Christmas in order to drink a toast to you, had supplied champagne from the wine cellar, wherever that may be.  The Cousins never touch champagne, so Doris and I drank alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank a comprehensive toast to "all the people I love".

We had a splendid mail awaiting us when we got back from church this morning.  It was so good to have it come on Christmas Day.  I do hope you got my first letter very soon after you sent yours.  I think I explained in it that people told us on no account to post letters at Gib. because it sometimes took months for them to reach their destinations from there.  So I only mailed you a postcard from there & sent my first letter from Naples the minute we landed on the 27th.

Dec. 26th.  Doris and I mounted on our gallant donkeys, (mine is named Sugar) and followed by our donkey boys (mine is named Mahmoud) rode off this morning towards the Libyan mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi - see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot.  The figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, making the entire height 65 ft.  Even in this land of mighty marvels they seem all that there is of the extraordinary.	  Well, dearest, dozens of other letters must be written, so fare thee well for now. 

Endless love and many blessings on your belove [sic: beloved] head. 
Your very own

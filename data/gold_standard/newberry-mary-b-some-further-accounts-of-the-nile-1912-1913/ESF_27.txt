Best Beloved - 		This is just to tell you how dear you were on Sunday.  Doris spoke of it, too.  You made your house very happy.  If you can possibly manage to get two more tickets to the Princeton game (for which I will pay) I can secure a young man to take Isabel and then I can go with you.  Said young man is Chilton Powell, a sort of cousin of mine, an instructor at Columbia, and an awfully nice fellow.  He was dining here last night and I sounded him about the game, in case I could get tickets, and heâ€™ll be tickled to death to come.  Please let me know (Gambier) as soon as you can, what the prospects are so that I can let him know officially. 
				
					Best love, darling, from
							Your Mim.

Dearest:       	Your Uncle says you are a splendid looking fellow an[d a] fine one. "And you are his Mother", he added.  "I am his proud and [happy?] Mother" I said.  To be justly a proud and happy Mother is to my thi[nking] the highest pinnacle of joy that a woman can attain.

                                                                                	Auf Wiedersehen,  Beloved

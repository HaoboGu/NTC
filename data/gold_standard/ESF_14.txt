Darling Gopher - 	You are my best and only Valentine, and I wish you were here or I were there to tell you so, viva voce.  I have noth[ing] interesting to record this time of my personal doings because my whol[e] week has been given up to homesickness and rheumatism.  I have suffe[red] torments with sciatica or neuritis or some kindred of diabolical disease in my left leg; and I’ve not been off the boat since going to church last Sunday morning.  To make matters worse the sun - the brilliant, constant, revivifying Egyptian sun - has withdrawn its light for two whole days, and it actually rained all day yesterday, resulting in t[he] damp and cold and gloom on which rheumatism thrives.  But I’m glad it[’s] not Doris who is stricken down be [sic: by] her old enemy.  If she had to bear [it] in addition to her daily task of Bridge I think she’d go crazy.

Day before yesterday when she came back from a morning across the ri[ver] at Luxor she announced that Ex-President Diaz with a party of "greasy looking Mexicans" was tied up over there in a gorgeous dahabya.  He must be glad he is here instead of in his war-tossed native land.  Mr. J. P. Morgan is also tied up over there on his boat, and rumor h[as] it that the Great Man is as cross as two sticks (he may be having a left leg, also) and making the lives of his guests a burden to them. 

We expect to leave here March 1st for Aswan, and I presume we shall find ourselves in Cairo again about March 15th.  Mr. Rudyard Kipling [is] there now.  I hope my next communication to you will contain more thi[ngs.] 

					The love I send you is endless
							          Your Mim.

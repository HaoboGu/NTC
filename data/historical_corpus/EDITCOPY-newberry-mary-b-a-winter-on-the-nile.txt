NEWBERRY Ellen Mary Buttles was born on December 23, 1864 at Talmadge, Ohio. Her father, Levi Buttles was a professor at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio. Her mother was Jennie Wright Buttles. There were six children in the family, 4 boys and a two girls. Her grandmother, Harriet Kilbourne Buttles, was the sister of Byron Kilbourne, one of the founders of Milwaukee. When Mary was a child, a cousin of her mother's, Theodore Davis, a very wealthy lawyer, visited in Gambier and was enchanted with her. Seeing that the family was very large and their finances were limited, he asked if he could adopt Mary. His offer was refused, but my grandmother told me that she went to her room and cried her eyes out because she thought she would be stuck in Gambier forever and would never see the world! Mary was married in Gambier in 1887 to Wolcott Ely Newberry of Cleveland. He was the son of a well-known geologist and paleontologist, John Strong Newberry who was a professor at Columbia. Wolcott was a graduate of the Columbia School of Mines and became manager of various mines in Colorado and later in Equador. They lived in Aspen for several years in the early 1890's and in Colorado Springs for a few years after that. Then he went to Equador to manage some mines there. Mary joined him there for six months. My grandfather became ill there and they returned to New Haven where he died in 1898 at the age of 35. She never remarried. I don't know how she managed to bring up her two children, Doris and Roger (my father). She had very little money, but somehow she scrimped and saved and was able to send them to private schools and put my father most of the way through Yale by living in a boarding house in New Haven in one room with my Aunt Doris, and when my father came home on vacations, she would rent a room for him. They used to go to Newport sometimes to visit Cousins Theodore and Emma Davis. One time Cousin Theodore suggested that Mary should buy herself some new clothes - he was tired of seeing the same dress on her. Whereupon she broke down and told him about her financial situation - and from then on he paid for my father's education. When my father came to Milwaukee to work for Bucyrus-Erie, his mother moved here also to keep house for him. And she lived here from then on. When Cousin Theodore died in 1922 or so, her inheritance made it possible to buy the first house she ever owned, "Windfall" on the River Road between the Schroeders and the Fullers. (which you may remember as the Squiers' house).  She had many, many friends all over the world. She was noted for her little Sunday supper parties. She would prepare a chafing dish which she served herself.  She trained the cateress, Elsie Possehl. Elsie's mother, Augusta Eisold, was her laundress and later became her cook, and Elsie's brother Elmer was her chauffeur/gardener/general factotum. With gas rationing it became necessary for her to move to town, and she lived in an apartment at the Astor until she died in December 1945. {no number}November 21, 1912Norddeutscher Lloyd -Bremen Dearest Adeline:- We've just passed Flores in the Azores where Sir Richard Grenfell lay, but in such thick weather that we only had misty glimpses of splendid crags towering up from the water, their tops hidden in cloud, and one white village on a cape-like projection. We'll have to go very close to the other Azores if we are to see them at all in this rain and fog laden atmosphere. But at least it's smooth. Day before yesterday was our one very rough day - only 30 people, out of 200, at breakfast; I, of course, being one of the 30. But even I would have liked to lie on my bed and howl all day with indefinable and baseless misery. The Atlantic Ocean is the one thing in all this wonderful world that could bore me to death. Even the luxuries with which we are surrounded, and everybody kowtowing, from the Captain who looks like Santa Claus to the least of the stewards, only slightly mitigates my mental ennui.Yesterday in search of distraction I went to the "Beauty Parlor" and had everything I could think of done to me, then went forth to shock my family with my new and fatal beauty. As a lurch of the ship shot me into their midst in our salon (we have a salon of our own) I forestalled comment by announcing loudly "My eyebrows are penciled and my lips rouged".  I was so amazed at the comments of the masseuse when she was working over me. Through a slit in my eyelids I observed her stealthily approaching with the eyebrow pencil, and demurred feebly "I never do that sort of thing", to which she replied with gentle decision, "You should always -you are not haf many eyebrow".  I must say I was much pleased with my looks when she had finished, and am beginning to understand how women become fools in their old age and take to making up. One of my pleasures has been the daily reading of my precious missive, and I was so much touched by the message from you and Augustus. I never knew you and he felt that way about me - I thought that feeling was all on my side - so it's made me very happy. I meant to mail this at Gibraltar but Cousin T. says it isn't safe to mail anything at Gibraltar as it sometimes takes months for things to leave there. Doris is a great help and Cousin T. seems perfectly devoted to her - even prefers her to me, I think. Isn't it lovely! Another dream come true. Friday. November 22. I found that today's message was from Mr. Theodore Blake, with a plea for "an occasional encyclical" so I'm going to ask you to pass on all my letters to him and Mrs. Blake. You see, you pampered darling, I mean to write frequently and fully to you, so frequently and fully that I very much doubt if any of my other New Haven friends get anything but postals from me. Last night at dinner the band played Dixie and a man sitting at a table near us, a man who looked like a gentleman, suddenly gave the most appalling shout, and another and another. I never in my life had heard the Rebel Yell, but I recognized it on the instant. Last winter in South Carolina I said more than once, and really believed it, that I knew just how the Southerners felt and that they had my full and understanding sympathy. But last night with that hideous sound in my ears I suddenly saw red and there was murder in what I had humbly hoped was a tender and a Christian heart! It's really rather ghastly to abruptly discover how much of the savage is still left in one's make-up. After dinner, in the smoking room whither Doris and I always accompany Cousin T., we heard people saying something about an island, and from the windows we saw one more Azore  -a huge black mass heaved up against an almost equally black sky, with here and there a light twinkling near the water's edge. That smoking room is one of the nicest places in the ship to sit. It's on the {1} upper deck and very airy. The only trouble with it is that Teutonic taste in decoration has been allowed to run riot. There are curious black splotches In raised groups on the walls, which look like symmetrical triplets of cockroaches, and occupying the place of honor is Venus rising from the waves all done in low relief in brass. Venus is knock-kneed and bumpy in outline, and the builders, with probably unconscious humor, have put in a fireplace beneath her. We've been sliding along today with as little motion as though we were motoring on a perfect road. Sunday, November 24. The enchantment has begun. We awoke to a glorious day, with the magic coast of Spain slipping by us. For the most part desolate and bare, it still looked so lovely in the morning sunshine that even the lonely watchtowers scattered in a broken line high upon the cliffs seemed desirable and romantic places of residence. At noon Algaciras -the white city of a dream - drifted into view, and there suddenly before us was Gibraltar, splendid, smiling, grim. The cousins have been here so often they no longer care to go ashore, (though I can't imagine living long enough to tire of it), so Doris and I went under the convoy of the peerless Jones. He is certainly the most amazing man servant I ever heard of. To all his other innumerable abilities he adds those of a first class guide. On the dock there was the usual foreign babel, the only silent thing being a huge and stately Moor who strode silently and indifferently past everything and everyone. Waiting beyond the wharf were dozens of little yellow carriages with canopy tops and scant curtains - a cross between bird cages and sedan chairs - drawn by sturdy, nice little horses. Into these vehicles everybody got and in a long line we scampered into the town. It looked perfectly absurd. It's impossible for me to describe the striking beauty, the strangeness, the fascination of that unique place, so arid and yet so tropical, - blank glaring stretches of wall and sudden vivid little hanging gardens - morning glories, poinsettias, clematis, bougainvillias (can't spell it): narrow and precipitous streets shut in between high walls - looking up them you see gorgeous patches of blue sky, looking down - far, far below, - a sea with ships. Gay groups of people, Spanish, English, red coats by the hundred, a fine military band playing in the Parade, the beautiful Public Gardens with the Spanish cedars that give me a feeling of delight I cannot put into words; and towering above all the grand summit of the Rock. When we had driven up and up we took to our feet and, escorted by Tommy Atkins, we walked up and up along a rock hewn path through a padlocked gate, which was carefully locked behind us, and into those wonderful galleries honeycombing the Rock and made by General Eliott and his men in those three besieged years. They show visitors only a very few of them. The only light comes from the loopholes where the guns look out. And crouching to look out of one of these loopholes down on that strange little narrow strip of sand - the Neutral Ground - one of the ship's passengers standing near asked the silliest question I ever heard. The guns of Spain were facing her; above, below, on either side, behind her, the mighty guns of England stood watching Spain. "And what keeps it neutral ground?" said she. "What is there to prevent anyone's coming and taking it? Is it a sort of spiritual compact?"Doris and I would have liked to spend a week there, but we thanked high Heaven for even three hours. And when we came back to the ship we watched the crowning beauties of the perfect day. Back of Algeciras rose the full moon. A snowy white steamer lying near us, glittering with lights, slid away into the Mediterranean, and as she went, from the crest of the Rock a flame shot out, a puff of smoke and the boom of a salute. Along the waterfront, the piers, the breakwater, long lines of lights appeared and suddenly Gibraltar was sparkling as if with jewels. Then we were off into the Mediterranean and as we rounded the point the lights of Gibraltar vanished, and there was the superb, blank, desolate face of the Rock, cold and dark and mysterious in the moonlight, with one ghostly little sail flitting along the base. {2}Tuesday, November 26. Just a word more. We are due in Naples tomorrow at the crude hour of six and I've got the. most part of my packing still to do and another long letter to write, and it's evering. The Mediterranean was perfectly lovely all day yesterday, and the coast of Africa strange and haunting and majestic. There was snow upon the mountain tops. It was after dark when we reached Algiers and Cousin Theodore wouldn't let Doris and me go ashore even with Jones. "They're all of them beasts in that town", he said shortly. So what we saw of Algiers was from the deck, and the lights and the tiers upon tiers of dim white homes rising to the top of the hill made a lovely effect. It's been choppy today and not quite so clear, but Sardinia has been with us most ofthe time - looking easily the haunt of bandits. We are crazy to get to Naples. Two days there and then we sail again on the 29th for Alexandria.Our love to you and Augustus and to Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Blake, to whom this is to go next and then to the dear Mitchells in Summerville, please.        Always your devoted        Mary Saturday, November 30. The Mediterranean.Dearest Adeline:- It was perfectly glorious Wednesday morning when we arrived at Naples. Bumping and banging and yelling began so early that even Doris the Dormouse was up and exclaiming over Vesuvius at six. But our party, being a slow and stately one, were almost the last to get off the steamer. The Grand Hotel had sent a special carriage for us, and away we drove, unencumbered by anything except a small black bag with jewels, while Jones and Amelia looked after the forty odd pieces of luggage. (It is really forty something in number.) As we drove along, Doris and I beaming with delight suddenly held up by two leaping, shouting bandits, who turned out to be Harry Burton, the delightful young Englishman who goes with us to Egypt, and my dear Jim Whittaker, who had come all the way from Florence (a twelve hour journey) just to meet us. The Grand Hotel is a perfect place to stay, being directly on the bay with the most heavenly views in all directions, and soldiers always drilling in the daytime, and wandering minstrels always singing by night in the street outside. Cousin Emma declined to drive that A.M., so Cousin T., Doris and Harry went off in one carriage and Jim and I in another, and climbed and climbed among reddening vineyards and stone pines, and along the mountain road to Pasolippo (don't know how it spells itself) with its gorgeous outlook. Jim and I got out and leaned on a stone wall and watched in a field, very far below us, twelve mounted buglers prancing about and bugling, apparently to accustom their horses to the sounds, the really beautiful sounds they made. That afternoon we all tea-ed at Bertolini's and when I stepped out on that terrace in the skies and saw the kingdoms of the earth spread out before me I almost died of the beauty of it. Before starting for Bertolini's, Jim, Doris and I had paid a visit to the Aquarium, which Mr. Agassiz used to tell us was the finest in the world. It's small enough for one to see all the wonders without getting tired to death. Never have I beheld anything as disgusting as the devilfish. It did what the Atlantic Ocean is powerless to do - it made me seasick. But I was revived by the antics of a crab that did a skirt dance for our benefit till we were in hysterics. That evening while the others were playing cards, Jim and I went to the music room and he sang. If ! were young he would have sung the heart out of me. He's got a lovely voice with a quality in it that tears you to pieces. Thursday. Thanksgiving Day, - with nothing to remind us of it except the many, many things we have to be thankful for, - was horrid, cloud and rain and mist blotting out everything. Jim and Doris and I went to the Museum in the morning and stayed until Doris announced that she was so  {3} tired she was beginning to hate everything. We all thought it was worth journeying to Naples simply to see that bronze "Hermes Resting", found at Herculaneum.Yesterday, another very beautiful day, we sailed, officially at noon but really not till two. The delay was caused by a tragedy. A poor sailor .or stevedore was killed when some cargo was being lowered into the hold, and we had to wait until the city authoritles would let us go. Doris and Harry Burton and I stood long on deck as we moved out of that superb harbor, and when we had sailed past Capri all the perfect beauty of the unparalleled coast unrolled before us, its many cIties and hamlets lying white in the shadow and pink in the sunlight. We were almost certain we could pick out the spot where        "Sits Amalfi in the heat         Bathing ever her white feet        In the tideless summer seas."  {extra written note: Longfellow}If only we can take that drive when we come back!We passed Stromboli near midnight, but it was sleeping so there was nothing to see but a huge black cone rising out of the sea. And we were sleeping when we threaded the Straits of Messina. We are very comfortable on this steamer, though not as luxurious as on the Berlin. All these German boats feed you to death. You could stuff till you burst if you were so "dispoged". There is everything on the menus to which the plain American has been accustomed from infancy (including "corned beef hache Americaine") as well as everything you never heard of from "Spitcake" to "Lobskaus with dilled cucumber". Sunday, December 1. And a mighty indolence is upon me, body and mind. My spectacles are broken and I can't see to read Baedecker's Egypt, and rejoice that I can't.There was a sunset last night that steeped our very souls in color. It filled the heavens, glittering gold in the west and mother-of-pearl in the east, while liquid opal shifted and vanished on the sea. Today it has been a calm sea and delicious warmth and a far dim glimpse of Crete. Tomorrow it ought to be Alexandria about noon and Cairo in time for dinner. And I hope that when we reach Cairo Doris and I will be able to remember that we are puffick ladies and keep from shrieking with delight. The moment we reached the hotel at Naples I posted 24 letters and notes I had written on the steamer, and Heaven send that they all reach their various destinations. You - all of you who read this - ought to have heard from me before this reaches you. Dear love from your ever devoted        Mary Tuesday, December 3, 1912. Shepheard's Hotel Cairo Oh, Adeline, and Oh, Augustus, and Oh, All You Other Dear People who read this letter - I simply love this land to death! Why did I say that Algeciras was "the white city of a dream"? Because I would so much rather have said it about Alexandria! It was so perfectly heavenly when  {4} we landed there yesterday - it was so more than beautiful as we drew near it on the sea - it looked like mIles of ivory palaces. floating on lIquid lapis. As we sailed through the narrow entrance into the fine harbor with .shipping from many and far distant lands all about us, and lovely square-rigged sailig craft riding at anchor, and the Khedive's palace facing us, and beautiful masses of color on the wharf where men in fezes and turkish trousers and gold embroidery, men in turbans and long straight robes of dark blue, pale blue, light yellow, orange, dull brown, soft green, white, black, moved and gesticulated and shouted - the voice of one of our compatriots said, pettishly, near us - Oh, this harbor is so dull.” I wonder why the gods permit people wIth scales upon their eyes to .travel. Though a .scene of mad and wholly enchanting confusion we tore to the railroad station in bumpy lIttle carriages wIth drivers who shouted enthusiastically every step of the way. Arrived, we took possession of two comfortable compartments reserved in loud red letters for “Davis Pasha", while Jones and Amelie did the work. They both speak Arabic, and Jones, imperatIve but courteous, and Amelie, moving about like a battering-ram and hissing out vicious syllables, accomplished the impossible. We were very late in getting off, but the glories of the evening still make shivers run up and down my spine. Burning red spread half around the horizon. On the right of us feathery pampas grass spread out in vast fields of the Cloth of Gold edging a lake pale blue like Montana sapphires, and a flight of ducks were silhouetted in black against it. To the left of us cream colored walls with palm trees towering above them, tiny vIllages of mud hovels, a fleet of sails among the fields where an invisible canal was flowing, tall figures robed in white standing motionless to watch the train, the Flight into Egypt repeated again and again on the high road, and towering over all the purple twilight (at last I've seen a purple twilight) with Venus glittering on its edge. We had expected to reach Cairo in time for dinner, but as it was we dined upon the train, and Doris and I were glad, for never before had we had a meal where Persian powder was dashed in splotches on the window panes to keep the fleas outside. We were waited upon with cyclonic ardor by two natives in snowy robes, red sashes and fezes. (There must be some other plural for that, but I don't know it.) At the station in Cairo three or four of Cousin Theodore's native servants were waiting to welcome us with kissing of hands and those touchings of the forehead and the breast that somehow look so theatrical. At the hotel the manager met us at the door and conducted us at once to a gorgeous suite of rooms, while all our traveling companions were waiting and writhing at the desk. All these ostentatious details I give you because it amuses me clear through to my backbone that we, the denizens of that tiny apartment in Orange Street the Despised, should be careering about the earth in Pomp and Circumstance.This morning while standing on the terrace of Shepheard's waiting for our bright red motor car, Doris and I were fallen upon by two old Colorado friends. Then we, escorted by Cousin Theodore and Harry Burton, went to the Museum where we had one of the sensations of our lives inspecting the wonders and the beauties of the Theodore M. Davis Room. Also we were taken into the Holy o fHolies and presented to Sir Gaston Maspero, who was most charming. He is fat and chuckly and of a great simplicity and sweetness, and wholly delightful. And he gave us each (Doris and me) a grey and gold permit "de visiter jusqu' du 30 Juin, 1913, tous les monuments fermes en enclos de la Haute-Egypte"  -besides, of course, the freedom of the Museum. After luncheon, while the Elders were napping, Harry and Doris and I escaped and did the bazaars on foot and saw more queer things in an hour than in most of our lives put together before. "The crowded streets of the bazaar" - every chronicler says that, but henceforth it will call up to my mental vision a vivid picture instead of the vague impression of old. We were a little frowned on when we returned, and it was suggested that we were probably packed with fleas or worse; but we were given the benefit of the doubt and were then swept off to see the Pyramids. It was a  {5} grey afternoon (we've not yet seen the sun in Cairo). And perhaps it was the absence of the fierce blue background that disappointed me at first. But when we had teaed at the Mena House and started home along that wonderful road with its endless procession of startling figures of men and beasts and veiled women (I had an uncanny feeling that we were driving through the Old Testament in a motor car) - we had only to turn our heads a little to see those strange and splendid monuments against the blood red sky of the sunset.Wednesday, December 4. Another grey day, but it doesn't matter in the least. Why should it, in a land where everything is a thousand times more enchanting even than you expected it to be? I had to stay in the hotel this morning doing dull but necessary things while the others went off and amused themselves. But this afternoon we motored out through that extraordinary new suburb Heliopolis, the perpetration of a German Syndicate drunk with power - and out into the desert until it was easy to believe that there was nothing in all the world but wide wastes and ridges and deep hollows of grey and shifting sands. We stopped on our homeward way for tea at the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, and watched people of various nationalities from those who spoke an unknown tongue to nice Englishmen with darling dogs. The cousins have seen all the wonders of this land for so many years that they "cannot", as Doris told Artin Pasha this afternoon - "cannot understand why we are so wild with excitement whenever we see a camel." (Indeed Doris riding a camel in Cairo would be much less conspicuous that she is on a horse in New Haven.) Artin Pasha, an Armenian archaeologist of distinction, and Prof. Sayce, Oxford Don, scientist of great renown, called this afternoon and talked delightfully. Artin Pasha wore his fez all the time, and I have to confess looked the "unspeakable Turk", blear-eyed and with a rather dreadful nose, and the Oxford Don wore a collar of prehistoric vintage, light brown socks and chopped-off Congress gaiters of black. Thursday, December 5. Today Cairo has basked in sunlight, but it's been a "white day", the sky lacking the deep Egyptian blue and the air somewhat hazy. We went to the Zoo, which was enchanting, visited the Beduin - our dahabeah - and I wish everybody I know and care for could see it. It's a beauty. Jones and Amelie, and the crew and native servants (20 in number) were all engaged in getting things spick and span. A small flock of ducks came paddling frantically up when whistled for and gobbled the bread I threw them. We are to move on board Monday and start early Tuesday morning. This afternoon we went to the Citadel and entered that wonderful mosque of Mohammed Ali, the minarets of which are so ethereal, so exquisite, you almost fear they will vanish as you watch them. We did not have to put off our shoes from off our feet, but we had to slip huge yellow slippers over them.Things go on being as deliciously strange as ever; a man sits on a bench in the Zoo and is shaved by an itinerant barber; a tall athletic figure clad in a heavenly blue garment strides across the street with three dried crocodiles under his arm, and no one but 615 Orange Street even turns to look at him. Every time we emerge upon the terrace of Shepheard's, fakirs with monkeys, cobras and mongooses meet our enraptured gaze, and the riot of color satisfies even my color loving soul. The notice in one's bedroom --       Ring once for the Waiter        Ring twice for the Maid        Ring three times for the Arab        tempts you to ring three times every fifteen minutes. And, by the way I forgot to copy, in my letter about Naples, a telegram I received there from Giulio Tedeschi, the young Italian whom we knew in England and who lives in Livorno. It was so deliciously un-American; this was it: "My {6} heartiest welcome, my fondest thoughts to you both, wishing had been able to come down with Jim. Am with you in my heart. Sending love to all." He told Jim Whittaker that he "would have given his soul" to come to Naples to meet us, but his mother was ill and he couldn't.        Now I must send this and write to someone else.        Faithful love,        Mary        December 9, 1912. Shepheard's Hotel CairoDearest Adeline - I've seen the Sphinx. In hot sunlight, with a sky of a blue to make one gasp, with the desert wind in our faces and desert sand sifting into our shoes, with an atmosphere of molten pearls in the distance, with here and there a white-robed Arab, a stately camel, a white donkey with gay trappings, with the pyramids towering in the background - we saw her. No description I have ever read, no picture I have ever seen had prepared me. I'd like to sit and look at her for days. The pyramids are tremendously impressive to think about, but it did not thrill me to see them; and I cannot describe the feeling that surged through me when I faced the Sphinx. Doris and I wanted to climb the Great Pyramid but Cousin Theodore absolutely refused to have us boosted by Arabs so we had to give it up. The Sphinx has been our great experience since my last letter. For the rest, the Arabian nights continues. We are wakened in the morning by the cry of the kites wheeling above the garden. When I fling open my blinds and look into said garden with its towering palms, its wonderful plants, its vivid lawns, I see a crane stepping "high, wide and handsome" along the bright red paths. This morning as I was standing on the terrace in front of the hotel a man went by on the sidewalk with a goat trotting along on one side of him and a monkey on the other. The white-robed, red-sashed, befezzed individual who salaams as he opens the dining room door for us, wears a silver ring inserted coyly in the top of his right ear. Gorgeous creatures, glittering with gold embroidery, seated at intervals in the halls, rise and salaam as we pass. But the thing that, even after a week here, strikes me as being a masquerade and not real life is the women on the sidewalks or in beautifully appointed carriages who look mysteriously at you with dark eyes gleaming above the white veil that hides the rest of their faces. The woman on the sidewalk for the most part wears the black veil, but she in the victoria or brougham wears the white. Yesterday after church at All Saints where Mr. Sayce preached an excellent sermon on "Thy Kingdom Come", Harry Burton and I drove to the Blue Mosque, crumbling but very beautiful and with several interior walls covered with superb Persian tiles, any one of which I should consider a treasure. Hundreds of youths and boys were seated in groups on the ground reciting the Koran at the top of their lungs. In the afternoon we had a little tea on the dahabeah (its name is the Beduin) and, while awaiting our guests, were infinitely amused watching the antics of our white cock and gorgeous drake each trying to assert supremacy over a certain spot on the bank. The drake was victorious and then proceeded to make himself look exactly like Napoleon. Our guests were Mr. Sayce, Artin Pasha, and an Egyptian gentleman Claudius Bey, whose hair turned snow white a few years ago when he went to meet his wife on an incoming steamer at Alexandria and found her murdered in her cabin. His two little girls, aged seven and five, are . living in England with their Grandmother, and he said he fancied he would have to go live in England too, as they absolutely refused to come back to Egypt -seven and five! I had an {7} absorbingly interesting talk with Mr. Sayee, who told me some inside history about Gordon, who has always been one of my heroes. This afternoon Harry Burton and I dashed out in the motorcar to see the obelisk. He couldn't tell me what obelisk and the guidebook had been sent to the Beduin. But it was worth going to see, and in the neighborhood was an estate enclosed in one of those high mud walls that fascinate me so, and between the obelisk and the wall a flock of goats were feeding, shepherded by three shrouded figures - quite perfect as a picture.Harry starts for Luxor tonight by train. There isn't a room for him on the dahabeah, worse luck - he's one of the most amusing persons I've ever known. We board the Beduin tomorrow some time. It's all enchanting whether we go or stay.        Goodbye, dears all, for this time.        Devotedly,        Mary       Tuesday, December 10, 1912.Dahabya Beduin   EgyptDearest Adeline:Our first night on the dahabeah (it really doesn't matter much how you spell it - though I doubt not that the way at the top of this is really the most knowing). We spent the morning in preparations to move from the hotel, paying bills, etc., and dashing across the street for final purchases at little shops. Also Cousin Theodore elected to make it Christmas for Doris and me, bestowing upon Doris a pearl and diamond ring and upon me a gold mesh bag - much too elegant for 615 Orange Street, but which really suits me to a T!  At about 2:30, after tipping whole tribes of Arabs and other more commonplace nations of the earth, we four entered the bright red motor car and scooted Nile-wards, followed by Jones and Amelie in another vehicle, the tops of their heads just visible above the masses of hand luggage packed around them. Although we had visited the Beduin daily it was with quite a different sensation that we stepped down our flowery bank (we have quite a garden) and really took possession. Then we all set to work putting innumerable belongings into what seemed absolutely inadequate spaces for them. But we finally evolved perfect order, the unpacked trunks were sent back to Cook's and the whole place looks like the Abode of Peace - a very luxurious Peace, I grant you! On answering a twice repeated summons to tea on the upper deck, I found a foreign gentleman of - to me - most unpleasant personality, who on being introduced to me, rose, brought his heels together, swept off is hat and bowed from the waist. Having had my tea and not being fascinated with the Russian, I sauntered off. I was told afterwards that he is a first cousin to the Czar, is fabulously rich, has an Egyptian museum of his own in Moscow, and for a long time was in the habit of bringing with him to the Nile a new wife each year. Whether at the end of each winter he fed the lady to the crocodiles, or reserved her for Siberia, history does not record.There is about a ton of brown bread cut in slices spread out to dry on the deck at the stern. It's for the crew. They like it that way. The birds hop joyously all over it, and a cat or two pay thieving visits to it. The crew and inside servants are twenty in number and are so silent it is hard to believe there is one on board. They wear blue sweaters with BEDUIN in red letters across the {8} heart, blue robes with gay bandanas tied about the waist and white turbans. All except the two captains, who wear black robes and no sashes. And also except Haneen the butler, whose raiment is much more important. He, I believe, is a Capt. and wears a fez instead of a turban. The second captain is a wholly ferocious looking individual. He looks as though he'd like to cut all our throats for the simple pleasure of doing it. But he's been on the Beduin for years and is a great friend of Jones, so I suppose he won't. There was a rose and orange and gold and turquoise and violet and dove grey and sea green sunset tonight and the slenderest thread of a new moon anyone ever saw. We hope to get off tomorrow. We are merely waiting for the tug which is to tow us.Wednesday, December 11. No tug appeared today; instead there came a young man from the firm of whom the tug is engaged, a gay and smiling youth named Schwartz, who announced that a telegram had come saying the tug was coaling at some place up the river and would arrive early in the morning. "A day late," I said. The Elders were napping so Doris and I were conducting the interview. "A day late", he said with a gay shrug, "but what is a day?". " Nothing in Egypt" I had to admit, and truly it has been so interesting watching the lazy life of the river that I don't care at all whether we go or stay. Mr. Schwartz plied us with questions, winding up with "This is a government boat?" "No, it is Mr. Davis' own. He had it built." "And you are going up the river alone?" "There are four of us." "But how dull! Me, I should want sixteen in the party!" Think of having to be polite for ten or eleven days in the narrow confines of a dahabya, to sixteen people! Doris and I would not in the least object to one man - the vastly amusing Harry Burton - but he went to Luxor by train last night, there being no room for him on the Beduin.Thursday, December 12. The tug came before we were up this morning, but we had to wait till the bridge opened at ten. It was very entertaining to see people trying to get across before the bridge should become useless, as such, for an hour and a half. Doris and I fell into an unseemly fit of giggling over a funeral, all on foot, "beating" it over the bridge as though they were going to a fire. When the draw swung we slipped through, followed by another dahabya flying the Stars and Stripes. We have no idea whose she is - we only know we sailed away from her early in the day and have had no glimpse of her since.It has been a vivid Egyptian day with all that that means of light and color. And what scenes! How can I even try to give the faintest idea of their strangeness, their charm, their savage or seductive beauty? And the River itself - small wonder that people have worshipped it for centuries. It has a human personality which I feel. For long after leaving Cairo we passed towns or scattered habitations more or less Cairo-like in their look and construction - cream colored walls and an air of civilization. Those came to an end and then there were long stretches of country, scattered native villages made of mud, with a beauty all their own, towering palms here and there - large groves of them sometimes - then the grain fields with a hum of industry about them and great barges being loaded or unloaded - and always behind them on the East Shore the Arabian desert with its line of hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, fierce, desolate, burning, superbly beautiful beneath the magic of the Egyptian sun, but intolerable to even imagine under a gloomy sky. At sunset we tied up to the bank between two tiny native hamlets. To effect the tying up process one of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder (this is a true statement) and worries it into the sand; two of the crew go ashore each with an enormous wooden pin the size of a country hitching post; two more of the crew, armed with gigantic wooden mallets, hammer these pins into the sand and to these we are tied. Then a desert stillness settles down upon us, while the stars blaze out overhead. {9} Friday, December 13. This is a land of pure delight. I've spent the entire day, practically, on deck, absorbed in watching shores Cousin Theodore pronounces "dull". The first thing we saw after breakfast (we started about an hour before we were up) was that strange monument the Arabs call the "false pyramid" -the Pyramid of Meidum, built in three concentric towers, the central one the highest. To me it's much more impressive than the other pyramids. The scenery today has been less spectacular than yesterday, but everything is so fascinating and there is no stretch so desolate but that you see some human figures, these splendid figures in their always artistic robes  -not blue as in Cairo where nine-tenths of the natives wear the most heavenly shades of blue, but in sharp contrast of black and white. Sometimes it will be a solitary figure seated brooding by the Nile, far from any habitation, or a group of women filling their water jars at the river, men working at a shaduf or, most delightful of all to me, a frieze-like effect against the sky (when the road runs along the top of a high embankment) or a camel loaded so with cane that you can only see his legs, a woman with a water jar upon her head, a donkey ambling along with a shrouded Arab sitting on his tail (almost), a camel with a rider swaying on his back, - I never in a thousand years could get tired of it. The strangest village we have seen today we did not at first recognize as a village - it so melted into the hills behind it, as bare and desolate as they - the whole scene made up of burning sand, glaring rocks and sun-baked mud, except, clear down in the foreground by the river, a tiny square of emerald grass with three lovely trees. Presently we came to the most fascinating sight of the afternoon - on a point at a bend in the river, and surrounded by palms, the cream colored Coptic Convent of Mar Antonios, with a splendid tree top springing up through the roof. Back of the convent starts a caravan route to the Red Sea. Just before the luminous dusk began to steal about us we slipped past an estate with a villa of importance and many outhouses and all the air of belonging to Someone-in Particular - perhaps to "Our Mother of the Khedive" as the dragoman say. And from beneath the giant palms three camels arose at the bidding of an Arab and slipped down to the river to fill up their fifteen stomachs. Saturday, December 14. And Doris' birthday. We have passed through scenes today considered uninteresting by those who have been up the river twenty-two and down it twenty two. But Doris and I loved every foot of it. About the middle of the afternoon we tied up to an island in order that the tug might coal at Shekh-Fadl, a town with a huge sugar factory close by on the mainland. Doris and I immediately took to the island for a walk, with one of the crew as bodyguard. I privately scouted the idea of the necessity when we started out but changed my mind before our return. An Arab of your own carrying a stout stick is a comforting appendage when you meet other Arabs in lonely stretches. Our island had no houses, but it did have numerous vegetable gardens. It was much larger than we thought when we first undertook to walk around it. Walking in the powdery sand along the shore was tiring, and then I proved that between persons o intelligence community of language is not necessary. "Why", said I to our Arab, who knows not a word of English, "can't we cross over here to the boat?" "Because", said he in Arabic, of which I know only the one. word "Kaddah" (liar), "we may not walk through the standing crop." Sunday, December 15. - and the first warm morning that we've had. We have passed close to the base of giant limestone cliffs where hordes of white-robed men were quarrying and tumbling great pieces of gleaming rock down to the water's edge. The sunshine on the scene made a blinding glare, but it was very beautiful; and then came the splendid Gehelet-Ter ("Bird Mountain") rising sheer from the water, and on its summit the Convent of Der el Adra ("Our Lady Mary the Virgin"). It is also called the Convent of the Pulley, because visitors used to be hauled up by that device. Now there are steps cut in the rock, and as we looked there came bounding down them with incredible speed a woman with a water jar on her head. Today we have seen for the first time those long, long stretches of brilliant green close to the river's edge, which in my childhood I {10} imagined bordered the Nile on both sides of its entire length. Also we've had clouds and two or three dashes of rain and strong winds that have blown the sand till the air has been full of a foglike mist. And now I really must write to my mother and my son and a few other persons who will stop loving me if I don't. This will be posted at Asyut tomorrow, and unless something particularly interesting happens I shall add no more to this edition. Except always my faithful love to my dear DuBois, Blake and Mitchell friends.        MBN       Tuesday, December 17.The Beduin on the Nile, somewhere near Abutig and about 260 miles south of Cairo.Dearest Adeline:- I'm not going to treat you to the best writing paper every time. If I used it all up on my personal correspondence I might cease to be persona grata on the Beduin. But this is the Royal Cambrian Writing Pad, which sounds as though it ought to suit the most exacting. We did not get to Asyut until one today, but our last hour of daylight yesterday was one never to be forgotten. For at least an hour we were skimming past the base of giant cliffs rising sheer from the river - the wonderful Gebel Abu Feda. Really cafe-au-Iait in color they were glowing with tints of unearthly beauty caught from the orange and rose sunset going on across the river. Their jagged summits cut into a sky of such ecstatic blue that it made my throat contract. (perfect color does that to me.) And high above the mast rode a silver half moon. Never before have I seen a really silver moon. We reached Asyut at luncheon time. Doris and I bolted that meal in haste and went ashore with Haneen as bodyguard, to take a drive through the town. We had to land in the felucca, and it was very pleasant being rowed by six Arabs handling their oars with a man-of-war's precision. We drew up at the bottom of a steep bank done in rough masonry and by means of a mariner at each elbow and my own active strides I was wafted to the top like a withered leaf (It is my regard for the Eternal Fitness of Things that made me say withered leaf instead of lotus flower, as I wanted to.)  In a rickety victoria with a woolly yellow mat seething with fleas under our feet, and Haneen perched beside the driver, who wore his turban at a rakish angle acquired only by the few, and who shouted every foot of the way to clear the road, we proceeded through the bazaar and the market. The bazaar was like Cairo, only not nearly so interesting, but the market (it was market day) was more than worth seeing. A mass of people, bulls, camels, donkeys in a dust trodden space with walls on three sides and the fourth open to heavenly green fields, and an imposing mountain in the background with an ancient burying ground and the ruins of the old city at its foot.Asyut is a prosperous and wealthy town, with many pretentious houses owned by rich natives, and some charming bungalows evidently inhabited by English people. The one other flaw, besides the yellow mat, to our expedition was the way the driver lashed the horses. "Haneen, make him stop whipping his horses." A word from Haneen which took effect for a minute and a half. " Haneen, tell him not to beat his horses." A minute of respite. "Haneen, it displeases me to have the horses beaten. Make him stop." Fierce remarks in the vernacular from Haneen, five minutes peace, then the wallopings were resumed and I gave up. You might have an apoplexy or burst a blood vessel trying to prevent it, and all in vain. The Beduin had moved up stream and the water {11} was too shallow for the felucca to reach the shore. Before we knew where we were "at", Doris and I had been lightly and skillfully picked up, carried through the water and gently deposited in the boat. One of the marked features of Asyut was that during our entire progress through it we did not see a single white person, though there must be a number of English in residence. I promise not to go on raving about sunsets - but tonight there was one, the beauty of which was beyond anything I ever dreamed of; when I thought it was over and done with it had only just begun. Egyptian sunsets will now be a part of what I mean when I say in the Gloria in Excelsis "We thank Thee for Thy great glory." Wednesday, December 18. I almost forgot to get dressed this morning in my absorption watching the panorama on the eastern bank as I hung out of the window. They had all seemed to garb themselves with an eye to symphonies. Two tan colored sheep were being driven by a man and a boy in tan colored robes. A man shrouded in black was riding a black buffalo. Another black buffalo had a man in black tagging at his tail. A camel swung along with his rider clad in camel color with a rose scarf around his neck -nothing could have been better. Doris has made two astounding statements today. Possibly wearied by my oft-repeated exclamations of wonder at the skill with which the women carry their water jars on their heads, she announced she was sure she could do it herself "Not full" said I. "Yes, full." "How far?" "Oh, quite a distance." "You don't really think you could!" "Yes, I do." On being pinned down relentlessly, she admitted that it might be wise for her to wear a bathing suit while doing it. Statement No. 2 was when Cousin T. and I joined her on deck this morning and she announced that a flock of cranes numbering at least a thousand had flown overhead. We couldn't make her come down a single crane. Yesterday I saw a lovely flight of snow-white ones, wheeling over a sandbar and then settling on it. The most spectacular thing on the shores today has been the stunning cliffs of the debel-el-Harideh, with ancient quarries and tombs, and - way up a gorge - an altar to a serpent with miraculous healing powers. There is a yearly eight-day festival in honor of said snake, a festival to which the Nile boatmen flock. We've seen scores of shadufs working the last few days, but this afternoon we heard for the first time the musical, lonely cry of the men who work them. Also as our dahabya was passing one man, he strode down the bank, yanked off his one and only garment and proceeded to wash it in the river. And the queer thing is you don't mind. Don't ask me why this is so because I don't know why. We overhauled a dahabya this afternoon flying the English flag. Her name was Enterpe. As she was sailing unassisted by any tug, we easily ran away from her. We have made seventy-two miles today. Thursday, December 19. Today has been made up of sunshine (as always) delicious warmth, enchanting sights on the shores, and birds innumerable. I myself counted sixty-two pelicans sitting on one sandbar. We have three little birds of our own, wag-tails, that fly along with us and eat cake after tea till they spoil their figures and actually begin to waddle. We are tied up tonight near Nag Hamadi, and the Masperos are tied up on the other side ofthe river. They started two days ahead us, but their boat is a heavy old thing.Friday, December 20. We were late in leaving Nag Hamadi this morning because the tug had to take on five tons of coal. Sixteen natives sat motionless on the bank and watched me for half an hour undoing a snarl in my knitting silk. It's their capacity for sitting motionless, I think, that has earned them their reputation for laziness, for they certainly can work, they are alert in their movements and they never grow fat. {12}We passed Kasr-es-Saiyad ("the Hunter's Castle") today and saw an amazing sight. What well might have been a castle was a pigeon house and nothing else. Hundreds of thousands of pigeons were perched upon its battlements, wheeling over it, swooping about it, while fresh flocks were hurrying towards it from all directions. Opposite Kasr-es-Saiyad lies Hon, the home of Shjekh Seline who died a few years ago after sitting stark naked on the banks of the Nile for 53 years. They have built his tomb on the sacred spot and the natives make pilgrimages to it. We expect to reach Luxor tomorrow and I shall begin a fresh letter there. It will be good to get letters. Ten days without mail is a long while. Adios, my dears all, and Heaven bless you.       Devotedly,        Mary        Christmas Eve, 1912. Dahabya Beduin Luxor, Egypt "By the fertile stream Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state Of valiant men with steeds and carsMarch through each massy gate."Don't you love that, Adeline? And to think that I am here! I cannot get used to the wonder of that. We reached here at noon on Saturday, a day like all our days - soaked in sunshine. We slipped "past garden wall and gallery" with glimpses of those lovely columns of the Temple of Luxor in between; past the Winter Palace, and then diagonally across the river to our mooring place on the west bank. We have it all to ourselves because most people prefer to herd in the thick of things on the east bank with their noses bumping each other's tails, until there isn't an inch left in which to tie a boat. So we are sole owners at present of a wide and lovely beach, back of which stretches a wondrous plain ofstrips of burning sand and strips of brilliant green and lines of trees, and back of all the glaring fiercely beautiful Libyan mountains where our valley lies. We made an encampment with the dahabya, a tent for the sailors, a lot of stylish yellow poles to which the clothes lines are attached, and two luxurious yellow coops into which the poultry farm is shoved at sunset. It was too amusing when the small coops were first lifted off the Beduin onto the sand and opened. Sir Francis Drake and his three ladies waddled madly for the edge of the bank, slid down it on their tails and hurled themselves into the water. The turkeys were so stiff they could hardly stand at first, but in less than five minutes the gobbler was strutting and rustling and gobbling as though he owned upper Egypt, including the Sudan, while the hen turkey was busily superintending one of the crew polishing copper pots with sand. To see the white cock stepping jauntily about no one would have imagined him to be a heart-broken widower, all his wives having been eaten on the way up. Perhaps he foresaw that he would have three more in about an hour and a half.  At luncheon the mail was brought from across the river, our first in 10 days, and we buried ourselves in letters. There was a dear one from you, Adeline. The afternoon waned in perfect beauty, of which I recked nothing, having suddenly gone to bed with a fiendish attack of neuralgia in my face. It passed after four or five hours and I slept like an infant and woke up Sunday morning very fit indeed and wishing greatly to go to the English Church at {13} Luxor and thank God for all His goodness. But my face was swollen still and Cousin Emma protested against my going, as the church, she said, was apt to be cold. So we all spent the morning on the boat. In the afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I and Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed over to Luxor in the felucca, and there our own donkeys and our own saddles and our own donkey boys were awaiting us, and off we rode to Karnak with our boys running beside us. And along the waterfront of Luxor Cousin Theodore had an ovation. Lines of dragomans and humble folk rose to their feet and beamingly shouted a welcome to him. As his own donkey boy said, kissing his hand, "All the world is thankables that Mr. Davis are come back!" They say he is known up and down the Nile as "The Friend of the Poor".It is impossible, I think, for anyone to describe those stupendous ruins with their deathless beauty and immortal splendor. It seized upon me almost like a sudden grief that stayed till the late afternoon chill began to tinge the air, and then ambled back on our donkeys. I adore riding a donkey. Mine is named Sugar, and my delightful little donkey boy, with the most engaging smile, is Malimond. Yesterday morning Doris and I attended by Malimond and Nobi (Doris's boy) rode again to Karnak and poked about alone with a map, and felt sorry for people being conducted by vociferating guides. On getting back to Luxor we joined the Cousins who were walking in the Winter Palace Gardens with Mr. Charles Whymper, that delightful Englishman with a much too loud voice, who writes pleasant books about birds and illustrates them with his own lovely pictures. Whymper, the mountain climber, was his brother. In the afternoon Cousin Theodore and Doris went off on their donkeys across the sands toward the Lybian hills and I, with six of the crew to row me and the ferocious second captain perched like a gigantic black bird at the stern, and Jones as escort, went over to Luxor to visit some of the native shops. We paid a visit to Mohammed Muhassib - the great and reliable dealer in antiquities, and because of his regard for Cousin Theodore, I was received with pomp and graciousness by the hoary, turbaned old Arab, and conducted into an inner treasure room where the casual purchaser never penetrates. We had his youngest grandson, a beguiling baby in yellow satin and fez-shaped cap of white, brought in and introduced to me. And then he gave me coffee fit for the gods, and I bought a small alabaster vase, and with many salutations I departed. I heard him telling Jones that one of his wives - "the old one" had died. They opened the dam at Assonan yesterday - a real attention to me on my birthday - and the Khedive and Lord Kitchener were there. I'd rather see Lord Kitchener than any man in the world.This morning Doris and I were rowed across and spent the best of the morning being shampooed and manicured. The young German who shampooed me kept ejaculating "Shocking - shocking" at the way my hair fell out. Just after we got back in the Beduin, a steam dahabya flying many flags, the Stars and Stripes among them, came steaming down the river and people waved to us from the deck, and we knew it was the Serapis with Emily Morgan and Miss Nelson and the rest of the Tuck party. And as soon as we could after luncheon we rowed over and called. And it was a joy indeed to see those two dear things. They are coming to tea tomorrow afternoon, which will make Christmas seem a little more like Christmas. Artin Pasha has got our party somewhat confused. I've had a note from him addressed to "Mrs. Burton" and beginning "My dear Mrs. Burton". Harry came over from the valley this afternoon to spend Christmas, and I asked him if I were his mother or if he had married me for my money. He was terribly teased. {14} The sailors - our sailors - have been rejoicing this evening, sitting in a circle on the lower deck singing songs that sounded like heathen incantations - all this because Cousin Theodore has given them a sheep for a feast tomorrow. I would like to hear someone sing Heilige Nacht. The glory of the Lord is filling the heavens. There is such moonlight as New England never has known. Christmas Night, 1912 - It's rather queer that snow and Yule logs and holly should be so essentially a part of the ideal Christmas to the Anglo-Saxon mind, when of course the real Christmas surroundings are like Doris's and Emily's and mine today - delicious sunshine and warmth, tropical vegetation, arid desert stretches. Just for today I would gladly have exchanged all this for the snow and the Yule log and Home. We had our presents before and at breakfast, and when the dining room table was cleared the ceremony of giving the crew and inside servants (there are 23 of these, mostly Nubians) their Christmas, took place. Cousin Theodore and Cousin Emma sat at the table, Doris and I on the divan, and Jones was master of ceremonies. They came in one by one, kissed our hands, said "Kulle sana w'uita taiyib" (a Happy New Year to you), each received a white shawl, a box of cigarettes, a bag of nuts and candy and some money. When it was over with they gathered on the deck and shouted "Hip, hip, hip, Hooray! Tank you, tank you, tank you!" And the rest of us washed our hands in dioxygen. Doris and Emily and I went to the little white stucco English church, which stands at the back of the Luxor Hotel gardens, walking among palms and acacias and other lovely things to get to it, and arriving in time to see an Arab give the final vigorous rings to the outside bell. The church was trimmed with palms and poinsettias, and of course there was the dear old service and the joyful Christmas hymns, and a quite unusual thrill at the prayer for "The President of the United States" even though he was tacked on at the tail end of the Royal Family.Doris and I brought Harry Burton and Mr. Crane back in the felucca to have luncheon with us, and the Beduin looked more that ordinarily beautiful in her gala dress of many flags. Mr. Crane is an artist and son of the better known Walter Crane, a very nice fellow and with a decided sense of humor, though not as constantly amusing as Harry Burton. We had a gay luncheon, and when the young men had departed for the other side of the river, Doris and I were free to read our fine crop of letters, and we did it with a ravenous appetite. At four the Serapis with all her flags flying steamed up near us and her felucca brought over Mr. and Mrs. Tuck, Major Curley, Miss Nelson and Emily - and you can all of you easily imagine what it meant to Doris and me to have even an hour of Miss Nelson and Emily. We took the whole party all over the Beduin and they were crazy about it. Then we had tea on deck with the Nile flowing by us on one side and our splendid plain and mountains on the other and sunshine and beauty everywhere. We could not bear to have our guests leave, but they left, and then Cousin Theodore and I took a walk on the sands with the sunset in our faces, and had to hurry back to escape the sudden mists that always arrive at sundown. We found Nicoll, the English artist who paints such exquisite pictures of Egypt, calling on us. I liked him immensely. He was asked to stay to dine, but had a previous engagement. So we four dined alone and had so much to eat before the turkey arrived that he was sent off untouched. But we had to nibble at the plum pudding. I pledged you all in champagne, and later on saw one of the crew dancing a sort of double shuffle with the bottle balanced on his head. It has been a lovely Christmas in its queer way, but Emily and the letters and remembrances from home were far and away the best part of it. Thursday, December 26. The Serapis went on her way to Cairo this morning. It is a very great disappointment to Doris and me that they did not stay long enough for us to do things together - and to Emily and Miss Nelson too. But they are, at present, no more the arbiters of their destinies {15} than we are of ours. About eleven Doris and I mounted our gallant donkeys and with Malimond and Nobi running beside us we were off for the Colossi of Memnon. Over the sands winding among deep hollows where the Nile water is still undried, along a path beaten hard by the feet of women bearing water jars, between garden patches, along deep cuts, jumping little ditches, and finally straight on towards those glaring mountains that make me catch my breath with delight whenever I look at them - over a dusty road with a cane field on the left and a train of fifty camels waiting to be loaded; and on the right a field presumably meant to be of winter wheat but really of crested larks filling the air with their sweet notes. The crested larks and camels absolutely ignored the Colossi of Memnon and when we got close to them and found we didn't reach, even on the backs of our chargers, to the tops of their big toes we wished that we too might feel a fine crested camelian indifference. Truly, I sometimes get worn out with emotions in this land of mighty marvels. We rode on a little beyond the Colossi towards Medinet Habu, and an Arab who had never entered my life before held me up to beg me to take some scarabs back to the Beduin to show Mr. Davis! "They are real, madam, as you see if only you look". "I do not know", I said fiercely, "the difference between real scarabs and imitation ones, so it's not worth while my looking". We rode back in a fierce high noon and the air was simply heavenly. As we galloped around the comer of a mud wall we almost collided with Mr. Crane and Mr. Carter on their way out to their diggings. They looked almost like a parade, their donkeys were so trapped out in red tassels. In the afternoon I went over to Luxor with the usual retinue of seven of the crew and Jones. One of the minor delights of this heavenly time I'm having is the being waited on hand and foot as if I were a Princess.I went to Luxor then to leave cards on some people at the Winter Palace and to do an errand or two. I promised you some time ago that I would not go on raving about sunsets. We've had them regularly every night, and with the rectitude of a lofty spirit I've kept silent about them. But you'll have to let me state the bare facts that coming back to the Beduin from Luxor this evening we were rowing into a brilliant orange that merged into rose color that throbbed up to the feet of the Evening Star, while from the horizon flared great streamers of pale green. Far down the river behind us the sky and the water and the very air were of the blue a sapphire would be if opaque, with snow white sails and creamy walls of houses and flashing lights gleaming against it. And our right hand oars dipped into melted amethyst and our left into liquid turquoise. I must stop now. If! write another sheet to this letter full well I know none of you would have the patience to read it. "Kulle sana w'inta taiyib" to you all. With oceans of love fromMaryJanuary 3, 1913West Bank-LuxorDearest Adeline:- It's a whole week since I've written, so this letter will be reminiscent instead of journalistic like the others. A week ago today we went out to the valley and stayed three days,  and though in some ways it reminded me of my mining life, in others it was a unique experience. The House in the Valley is seven miles from the Beduin on the west bank. Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones rode. I meant to ride but at the last moment found Cousin Emma didn't want to drive alone, so I drove with her in a sort of surrey thing drawn by two black mules and driven by a bandit in baggy white trousers. First across the sands straight towards the mountains, then at right angles along a ticklish shelving road on the edge of a very deep cut, then a sharp turn towards the mountains again, through a tiny biblical village with palm trees and a well, out again in a minute into the glare of the desert, and then on a hard white limestone road up to the mountains and into the mouth of the valley. And there my breath left me - for it was like the {16} wreck of a world. On and on we drove through towering cliffs and amid a titanic chaos of broken flints and splintered rock and fossil shells, with not even the memory of a green growing thing for miles upon miles. And then we came to a fork in the valley with a jutting ridge, a mighty one between, and to the left goes the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings and to the right the West Valley where Cousin Theodore's house is. It is a long, low and plastered structure with a flat roof, like thousands in Mexico. The dining room is at the front end and the sitting room at the far end, and between the two runs a hall with four anchorites' cells for bedrooms opening off it. Rough cement floors, rough plastered walls with little slits of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls. When we drew up in front of this residence slaves dashed out and kissed our hands and did our boots with a feather duster. The rest of the party were hot on our heels. Julius Caesar (Cousin Theodore's donkey - and a perfect devil) braying his head off. He so loves the sound of his own voice that he brays all the time. Then we entered and took possession, Harry Burton doing the honors. As Cousin Theodore's Manager of Excavations he lives in the House in the Valley. He'd given up his room to me. "It may smell of disinfectant, but it's all right - it doesn't mean anything except that the last chap died here, you know", he explained. A short time before we arrived they had killed a five foot snake by the great water jars in the shed near the front door, and Doris found a deceased mouse in her wash basin. So I felt rather squeamish when I entered my cell after dark and wondered what I might possibly touch before I got the candles lighted; therefore when the whole box of matches flared off at once in my hand I most naturally shrieked. The nights were wonderful, the stars blazed so close you could almost pick them from the velvet sky, the silence surpassed anything I've ever known - no faintest shadow of a sound except when a sudden gust of wind swept past, and was utterly gone, like the moan of a wild beast. And all night long a guard with a rifle stood at the front corner of the house to ward off any wandering sons of the desert who might drop into the valley by the jackal trails leading over the cliffs. The next morning we had a sort of royal progress into the valley ofthe Tombs - Cousin Theodore on the vociferating Julius, Cousin Emma in a carrying chair with two bearers, Doris and Jones and I on foot. That morning was one of the sensations of Doris's and my lives, but I won't bore you with descriptions, for is it not all written in the Books of Belzoni, Weigall, Budge, Dans, Petrie and others? Aside from all the wonder and beauty and impressiveness that we saw there was the fun of sailing by groups of staring tourists into a place labeled largely "No Admittance" and entering the tomb of Siphtah where Cousin T. is doing the only excavating at present going on in the valley. It was very dusty and very dark except in flashes where the light was thrown in by a mirror at the mouth. And a procession of children were carrying out the debris in baskets. The thing I hate in this country is the way they work the children.  At Karnak overseers stand by with long-lashed whips, but our overseer is not permitted a whip. That afternoon I took a walk by myself, climbing a ridge and going down into a third valley and up another ridge. The sun had set and the silence was dreadful, and suddenly a horror of the desert (quite different from ordinary fear) seized me and I fled back to the house, where I was seriously taken to task for wandering about by myself.  Sunday afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I made an expedition up our own west valley, and anything more superb, austere and overpowering I think I've never seen. Two or three of the Kings elected to be buried there, and I wonder all of them didn't; it's so much more spectacular and imperial than the other valley. Monday morning immediately after breakfast Cousin Emma and I departed, the others reluctantly promising to follow the next day. And wasn't it good to get back to the Beduin and bath tubs and clean clothes, and the haunting river with its palm trees and gardens on the Luxor side, and the desert all the more beautiful for being retired to the background. {17}Tuesday morning Cousin Emma and I went across in the felucca and paid Mr. Whymper a visit at the Winter Palace and saw his last picture - a thing of beauty - birds on a sand bar, with all the melted opal tints that we so often saw in the atmosphere as we came up the river from Cairo. He also showed us a splendid study of a vulture, looking almost as noble as an eagle as he clasped a lonely crag. "Close to the sun in lonely lands," I quoted, and Mr. Whymper, who is a very sudden and enthusiastic person, almost clasped me -"No! you don't know that! How wonderful! Dear old Tennyson!" he shouted, and then together we bellowed the whole verse. From Whymper we proceeded to call on the Contessa Contadone who, haply, was out. She came to tea yesterday bringing a tired-looking young Englishman named Tremaine, whom she always has in tow, with her. We found them here when we got back from Medinet Habu. What ruins those are -what color and carving! Each place we go to seems more beautiful and more incomprehensible than the last. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I rode out to Der-el-Bahri. The start was tumultuous and I almost gave up the expedition for the donkeys behaved so awfully. Even the heretofore irreproachable Sugar was suddenly possessed of Satan. Doris vows that at one time all three donkey boys and two of the crew were engaged in holding me on. It may be true. Personally I never can remember details when a cyclone has struck me. But Der-el-Bahri with its ruins of the mortuary temples of Queen Halshppsul and King Mentuhotep, with their entirely different character from the other ruins we've seen, with their exquisite columns and cloister effects and the very beautiful view from their site high up on the base of the Libyan ranges, a view over the desert, across the Nile and to Karnak beyond - all this was worth persevering for.Saturday, January 4. This is coming to an abrupt close. I'm suffering tonight from an inexplicable revulsion of feeling. I would rather - as I did - watch the row of kingfishers who practically live on our cable and are too funny for words - than see the most beautiful temple in all Egypt. And I would just as soon drop all my few jewels into the Nile as to read about Karnak or Luxor or the Valley of the Tombs or anything in the world that's instructive. I'm very cross because I've got neuralgia in my scalp - of all places - and I've torn my one and only decent hat to pieces and can't get it together again, and you can't buy a hat this side of Cairo. So - well beloved friends - I'll bid you good-night - and in some happier frame of mind bid you good-morrow.        Your devoted        Mary Sunday, January 5, 1913.LuxorDearest Adeline: - It's been a beautiful day - and anything more trite than that observation in this land could not be invented.  Have I said anything about the climate?  It's the one, for winter, that I've dreamed of all my life. You can count, with almost absolute certainty upon waking up every day to sunshine. You can cook to your heart's content by sitting in it, or be as cool as you like by moving into the shade. The one thing you have to be careful about is to always have a coat or wrap within reach. Doris and I, accompanied by Amelie (who is French Protestant) went to church this morning, arriving in ample time to admire the bougainvillia spreading its splendid blossoms all over the white facade of the little chapel. That is, I had time to admire it - Doris dislikes it because of its color.  But I maintain that magenta suits the tropics.  We were also in ample time to have our tympanums cracked by the bell which a native was jangling with primitive enthusiasm. The rector looks awfully ill and races through the service at that breakneck speed that is so trying to my slow {18} nature. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I took a long ride through larger tracts of cultivated land than we had previously seen. Steam ploughs were at work and the irrigating ditches were cemented and it all looked very modern and progressive and much less interesting and picturesque. Monday, January 6. This has been a lovely day (of course) but not an eventful one. Doris and I went over to Luxor in the morning and I had electricity applied - with comforting results - to my neuralgic scalp. Then I sat for a little while on the sunny rear terrace of the Winter Palace and talked to Mr. and Mrs. Davenport of Lincoln, Mass., while Doris was talking to some English people on the front terrace. I stayed at home in the afternoon and tried to prolong the life of my stockings, until I had to cram them all into my mending bag on the advent of Baron and Baroness von Bissing and Dr. Hermann Kees for tea. They came along the sands from their dahabya Aziz, which is lying below us on the same side of the river. The Baroness is quite charming and speaks English beautifully. The Baron is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon. He pounces on your hand and kisses it, is never still a minute, talks excitedly and amusingly, is immensely clever, gulps down cup after cup of tea and bolts his food with the rapidity of chain lightning. Dr. Kees may be and probably is possessed of vast learning, but he is afraid to speak English which he evidently understands, and his appearance is all that there is of callowness - he looks as though "de eggshell not yet off is back". Wednesday. January 8. Yesterday was a day too crowded for any epistolary efforts on my part. It began immediately after breakfast with a call from a sailing dahabya which, from lack of wind, had paused just above us. Its occupants, a Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence and a Mr. and Mrs. Pope, were crazy to meet Cousin Theodore, so they called. We liked them. They were very "plain Americans" from Ohio, and took liberties with our mother tongue, but they were awfully nice. Mr. Pope explained to me apologetically that he knew nothing whatever about Egyptian things as he "never had been a historian". When they had departed we, all four, went across the river in the felucca, the others stopping at Mr. Nicolls' dahabya to see his lovely pictures, and I going on to Luxor for a fitting of a blouse which is being made for me by a person who advertises herself as "Ancient dressmaker to the Queen of Holland". Harry Burton came over from the valley and lunched with us and in the afternoon we all proceeded to Medinet Habu to gaze upon the site where Cousin T. means to dig next. The others rode, but Cousin Emma and I drove in a sand cart, a low hung, one-seated, two-wheeled cart, the tires of the wheels being as broad as those of a motor car. A white mule was our steed, I held the reins, and the driver and one of our sailors careered along beside us. I thought it was fun. Cousin Emma thought it was awful, and vowed that never again would she get into that kind of vehicle. It is the Coptic ruins adjoining Medinet Habu that we mean to excavate, and while we were wandering about the appalling masses of debris a strong wind sprang up, and we got a taste of what a sandstorm can be like. We made a frantic dash for home, and through a misunderstanding Doris got left behind, and when I discovered it I had five thousand fits. When we reached the dahabya Jones' stern inquiry "Where is Miss Doris?" was the final straw. I'm afraid my voice rose almost to a shriek as I said "Nobi wouldn't dare not to take care of her!" (Nobi is her donkey boy.) A sailor was instantly dispatched on a steed and Doris says he nearly rent Nobi limb from limb when he finally met them, and it was in no way poor Nobi's fault. Baths and evening clothes restored our poise, and Doris and I made our first plunge into Luxor society.  Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, fascinating Americans stopping at the Winter Palace, had invited us to dine and stay for a dance. And what an entrancing way to go to dinner!  We stepped {19} into the immaculate felucca, and skimmed down the starlit river, with six white turbans bowing rythmically before us as the men bent to their oars. Two of them, carrying lanterns, escorted us from the landing to the hotel entrance and we found them standing like statues awaiting us when we re-emerged in the middle of the night. We had a lovely time. Doris was much entertained by amusing young Englishmen, some of whom danced well, and I enjoyed myself enormously talking to some people and watching others. The Contessa was there looking as ghastly as a clown at a circus. "They say" that last year she had yellow hair and a red face. This year she is in mourning for her divorced husband (who was, very properly, shot a short time ago) so now her hair is black and her face whitewashed. A young Englishman, who evidently hates her, told Doris that she was the deplorable kind of elderly female who loves to have a phalanx of boys about her. As I'm that kind myself I'm beginning to think I may like her when I really know her. She has invited me to ride with her some time. This afternoon Doris and I rode to our beloved Karnak. All Luxor watched our start and small wonder, for there were nine men -six of the crew, two donkey boys and Jones trying to saddle Sugar to suit me. This sounds as though I were getting fussy but I'm not. It's only that Sugar has such a small tummy that it seems impossible to cinch a side saddle to him securely, and it's misery to ride on a turned saddle. Later Cousin Emma and I teaed on the Aziz with the Von Bissings, whose table fairly tottered under the weight of things to eat.Thursday, January 9. A perfectly delicious day - it really has seemed to me the best air we've had yet.  Doris and I had a heavenly time this morning. We rode out to the Ramesseum starting early and taking only Nobi and Malimond with us. It was lovely there - in a way I liked it better than any of the ruins we've seen - there were no tourists, no excavating going on - just silence and remoteness and sunshine and the mighty past. Mr. Nicoll came over this afternoon late to say goodbye. He starts back to England tomorrow. We hear Lord Kitchener was in Luxor this afternoon. So near and I didn't see him! I have said - and believed I meant it - that there wasn't a man in the world who could make me marry him, but if Lord Kitchener proposes to me I shall undoubtedly accept him.Friday, January 10.  An exciting note from Harry this morning before breakfast saying that he has unearthed a red granite sarcophagus, that the lid has fallen off, top downward, but evidently has a recumbent figure carved upon it, and that it will take him about two days to remove the debris in which it is embedded. Cousin Theodore has lost all interest in the tomb of Siphtah, for some incomprehensible reason, and when he came in to breakfast and I said "Isn't it thrilling about the sarcophagus?" he merely said "Ha!" But later he announced that he thought he'd ride over to the valley tomorrow and take Doris with him - adding that he didn't think that the discovery of the sarcophagus would prove to be of the least importance.  Doris went to ride by herself this afternoon, with a nautical escort, on the other side of the river and I took a walk with Cousin Theodore on the sands. In one place where there were some damp hollows about 40 or 50 wagtails were apparently playing a game. It was charming to watch. They would jump into the air and land lightly again with a little flutter of wings, run a few steps and then jump into the air. It was actually a gray afternoon with a heavy and depressing atmosphere. The Von Bissings lunched with us. The Baron's descriptions of things are unique. He was telling about a tree he had seen in the morning that was "entirely ill and losing all its sings"! The Baroness says their little girl (at home in Munich) always prefers to speak English "because" the child says "to speak German makes me so hot!"  I think that's a perfect description of the effect on one of a difficult tongue.       Goodbye for this time, my dears all        Your devoted Mary {20}Monday, January 13, 1913.West Bank, LuxorDearest Adeline;- Cousin Theodore and Doris are just back from the valley, having, like the unreliable persons they are, stayed two days and nights when they said they would only be away one. Doris is wild about the sarcophagus, and they both went into the tomb and saw it, though Cousin Ernma and I had given them cast iron orders not to, fearing it would cave in on them and we miles away. The sarcophagus is of red granite, is 10 ft. 3 in. long, 5ft. 3 in. wide, and 4 ft. 8 in. deep. It is covered with inscriptions and bears the cartouches of Siphtah. It is apparently in a perfect state of preservation. The lid, which is lying beside it, face downward is 1 ft. l0 in. thick, and evidently has a recumbent figure carved upon it. By lying on her tummy Doris managed to see the two great feathers, part of a wig and one ear. Everyone of us is now agonizing for fear the nose is broken. The sarcophagus is filled with debris and we don't yet know whether it contains anything of value. A lot of broken alabaster objects have been unearthed in one comer ofthe chamber, and Doris is the ostentatious owner of a small alabaster head with a lovely face which she saw dug out. Isn't it gorgeous that we are here with things like that happening? I was so anxious to hear their tidings (as well as needing exercise) that I started out on foot this afternoon hoping to meet them. Once in a while I do like to take a walk by myself, so I tried to slip off without being seen. But the eagle eye ofthe ferocious second captain detected me, and in three minutes I was being escorted by Sala, of the crew, with his heavy stick in his hand. We ploughed through the sand till we reached the little path running through cultivated stretches, then at right angles along the broader path which answers for a highway and is ankle deep in dust, and where I had to sidestep donkeys laden with sugarcane and camels with mounted police; this for a long distance till I came to a tiny mud village with an encircling wall, from the top of which a yellow dog desired greatly to hurl himself on top of my hat, then under some fine lebbek trees, across a bridge an up on the embankment overlooking the vast plain where the Colossi sit forever in state. There were hordes of people donkeying along (tourists mostly) but my party were nowhere in sight so I turned around and came back again. I think white women never walk here, except along the waterfront at Luxor, and if I'd been "a efflant" or a rhinoceros I could hardly have attracted more attention. It has been a grey day and I've resented it most unreasonably. One really ought to be able to bear one grey day out of forty sunshiny ones, particularly when reading the newspaper accounts of the frightful weather at home. I am so sorry and so concerned for you all. The Fahnstocks of New York and Newport have tied up in their Dahabya Cheops just to the rear of us and their washing and ours have been flapping on the sands in sweet accord all day. Tuesday, January 14.  Harry Burton came over from the valley early (Tuesday is his holiday) and he and Doris and I crossed over to Luxor, they to wander among the beauties of Luxor and I to be prosaically shampooed. The morning was so gorgeous I hated to spend it that way. Harry lunched with us on the Beduin and when he had, later, turned his donkey's nose toward the valley and Cousin Theodore had arisen from his nap, the latter gentleman, Doris and I rowed over to the Luxor landing, mounted our donkeys and started up the river - a ride new to me, though the others had taken it once before. But we had barely started when Sugar's conduct became unfit for print. He nearly threw me down an embankment, he brayed in a manner that out-Juliused Julius, and I simply got off and refused ever to ride him again. The others rode on and I descended the bank and sat in the felucca until they returned. {21}The felucca had, according to orders, moved up stream till directly opposite the dahabya, and therefore was lying in front of the tiny native village at which we gaze daily from the Beduin. While sitting there I had ample opportunity to observe native life, some of which - like Sugar's behavior - would sully these fair pages if chronicled thereon. The most pleasing episode was the gambols of the children with two fuzzy black puppies whose sombre fate it is to grow up into abhorrent, snarling, unloving and unloved Egyptian dogs. Three men in black robes and white fringed shawls wound around their heads strode down the bank from the hamlet with a small flock of sheep, which they picked up one by one and deposited in a boat. The animals neither struggled nor uttered a bleat. Presently in a sort of hurly burly of dust, barking dogs and shouting children, Cousin T. and Doris, with their escort of donkey boys and sailors, came down the bank, and we rowed home to the Beduin. We found Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson teaing with Cousin Emma. Dorothy Richardson is the daughter of Dr. Richardson of Athens and an uncommonly attractive young woman. Her uncle, Mr. Hardy, is an ex-diplomat of sorts, whom I suppose I ought to be able to place but can't.Wednesday, January 15.  I crossed over at ten o'clock to play tennis with Dorothy R. on the Winter Palace court. We had two good sets before the sun grew too fervent, and then I left her to her letters and started home for mine. Wednesday is our best mail day. En route to the felucca I paused at the chemists and whom should I encounter there, buying a toothbrush, but Mrs. Fred Morley, who for two or three years was my next door neighbor (and a very nice one) in Colorado Springs! This afternoon Doris invited Dorothy Richardson to ride to Karnak with her, and they were gone a long time and, Doris said, enjoyed themselves vastly. At tea time we had a visit from Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero who came down the river in the Dahabya Miriam two days ago and are to be here a couple of weeks. On Monday he is going over to the valley to give The Last Word as to the importance of the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. We are divided between our hopes that it will be so fine that Maspero will want it in the Cairo Museum, and that it will fail by a hair's breadth to meet that requirement so that we can give it to the Metropolitan.I forgot to record that Doris and I were again invited to dinner and the dance last night at the Winter Palace. I declined, but Doris went and had a lovely time and met a lot of English officers.Thursday, January 16. Nothing of any particular interest to record today - just a lovely day, beginning pleasantly with waffles and maple syrup, and proceeding with a little too much wind and therefore sand in the atmosphere. We all stayed by the Beduin this morning but in the afternoon Doris and I took the felucca and went over to call on Mrs. Morley. She and her son Fritz are on the Egypt, one of Cook's new Nile steamers, and are here for a couple of days on their way up the river.  W.e took them over to the Winter palace to show them those lovely gardens which have grown truly as if by magic in just four years. Incidentally we saw the little Egyptian gazelle buck looking so dainty and charming it was hard to believe he had recently killed four of his own children. We had tea on the terrace before separating, the Morleys to return to the Egypt and we to the Beduin. If you could but see the stars from the vantage point of the Nile!  Is there any other land I wonder where Sirius glitters with such a blue diamond light?Friday, January 17. A lovely morning and a disappointing afternoon. Shortly after ten Doris and I crossed over the river and went to see Mr. Whymper's pictures. We attracted the attention of that gentleman by the simple process of whistling outside his window, his room being on the ground floor of the Winter Palace. I did the whistling during and in spite of the protests of my daughter, who seemed to think it a very vulgar proceeding. It has the advantage of giving the {22} victim no chance of escape if he happens to be sitting by the window, as this one was. We had a delightful half or three-quarters of an hour with him while he tore up and down his room and ranted with a pipe in his mouth and a checked cap on his head (except when he periodically remembered and took it off only to clap it on again in a fit of abstraction). He mimicked people looking at pictures, and birds in their native haunts till you could see the latter quite as distinctly as the former. And he showed us some lovely things he had painted. One gem of Medamet is tearing me to pieces. Its price is just the sum of a check Mrs. Thompson gave me for Christmas, but a conflict rages in my "buzzum" because I had determined to buy with it some piece of jewelry, and I can't make up my mind which could give me the greater and more lasting satisfaction. I have a barbaric fondness for jewels. This afternoon the donkeys were brought over to this side of  the river and we three were to have ridden to Medinet Habu. But the wind blew up and Cousin Theodore wouldn't go and made such a row about Doris and me going that we compromised and I stayed at home. And now Al Allah for this week, and dear love to you all.       Mary Sunday night, January 19. West Bank, LuxorDearest Adeline:- We have with us again the moon silvering the surface of the Nile, turning the desert sands to snow and driving the dogs of Luxor mad. At least I suppose it is the moon. It certainly is not joie de vivre which makes them bark, for the poor things haven't any. But Kim flying up Orange Street frenziedly barking at the victoria containing Mr. Justice Hotchkiss (a spectacle Kim always finds intolerable) does not make more of a row than each and every canine dwelling across the river on those nights when "the moon doth with delight look round her."Doris and I went to church this lovely morning and managed to be late, which was wholly unnecessary as we had been sitting on deck waiting for the time to get into the felucca and be rowed over. Mr. Whymper was also late and came racing after us as we neared the church door, and we all hurried in together without his having a chance to criticise our clothes. "What's this for? And what's the meaning of that? Women wear such rummy clothes!" He observes in an amused voice, usually when he meets us.When we got back to the Beduin at luncheon time we found a very nice batch of letters from home - yours of the 31st December, Adeline dear, for which so many, many thanks, was one, and another from Susan in Summerville giving unstintingly the hallmark of her approval of Doris and my devotion to that dear place.About half past four a cavalcade started for the valley. Cousin T., Doris and Jones mounted on their respective donkeys, and my new donkey loaded with luggage and groceries instead of with me. And tomorrow morning that matchless trio of Egyptologists - G. Maspero, T. Davis and D. Newberry - will pass final judgment upon the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. Cousin Emma and I heroically remained behind to dispense tea and cakes to some people named Sprague from Buffalo, who had brought letters and whom Cousin T. refused to be bothered with. They brought a young niece, Alice Keating, with them, whom I liked. Mr. Sprague reminded me somewhat of "The Man from Home" and he certainly voiced my feelings when he said that in this land he was "completely dazed by the enormous amount of what he didn't know". {23}My own doings today have been of the humblest compared with the brilliant career of my daughter. I spent the whole morning straightening out Cousin Theodore's bank account, and when I had finished my temperature was 120. After luncheon, to clear my brain and get some much needed exercise, I went forth on a long walk with a sailor at my heels. I saw lovely things - stretches of sloping river bank clothed in bean plants blossoming forth in stylish black and white flowers, great fields of peas with their reddish violet blooms, some brown little boys entirely nude who dived frantically for their shabby garments when they saw me coming. Then home packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village through which my walk led me. On the deck of the Beduin in the lovely afternoon light, I found the Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine taking tea with Cousin Emma. Another guest arrived on a donkey, Dr. Alan Gardiner, an Englishman eminent for something but I don't know what. All I know is that he's much too fat. And then our ears were smitten with an appalling though distant bray and we knew our family was approaching. They looked like pictures of explorers returning from the heart of Africa as they came in single file across the sand the baggage donkey at the head. Doris was beaming, Maspero had pronounced the sarcophagus superlatively fine - saying there was only one other like it. He was unwilling to have the lid (lying face downward on the ground beside it) turned over without the utmost care and is sending to Cairo for the proper apparatus. He wants the sarcophagus for the Cairo Museum, but he wants Cousin T. to pay for its transportation thither (he says it will cost 250 pounds sterling to do it) and Cousin T. does not at the moment feel inclined to do it. Maspero and Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, lunched at the House in the Valley with Cousin T., Doris and Harry Burton, and Doris says it was the treat of a lifetime to hear Maspero talk, which he did from one o'clock till three-thirty. He talked about Egypt and excavations, about Louis Quatorze brocades, about Chinese porcelains, about music, about the way the Cretan women dress their hair, about Sevres enamel, about most of the beautiful and interesting things in the world. Isn't it simply splendid that Doris could have had such an experience?Tuesday, January 21. This has been a day! Some of the narrative of its events may tax your credulity but I shall tell things simply as I saw them. The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic to Medinet Habu, and we agreed to meet her out there at eleven o'clock. We started gaily forth at ten with Nobi, Malimond and one of our sailors as escort. Doris has changed the name of her donkey (which some idiot had christened "Lovely-Sweet") to Hermes, because he goes so fast. My new mount, Wadi HaIfa, the nefarious Sugar's successor, is a jewel, and I now see delectable ambles spreading out on an almost endless vista before me. We had gone only a short distance when Doris had a nasty spill. Her donkey stepped in a pitfall (forgetting that he was supposed to have wings to his heels), threw her, fell on her and kicked her - not viciously but in his struggles to get up. She declared she was not hurt and insisted on proceeding to the picnic. (A lame shoulder for two days was the only bad result). Promptness being one of our petty vices, we were of course the first at the rendezvous. The Contessa and the rest of the picnic did not arrive till quarter of twelve. But who would mind waiting indefinitely at Medinet Habu on a glorious day? The Contessa brought with her to entertain her guests the Snake Charmer of Esneh, whom she had summoned down for the purpose. We started out at once skirting the Coptic ruins which lie close to the southwest walls of the temple. Walking with leisurely steps in advance of us went the stately figure of the Arab in his black robe and white turban, with the ordinary long stick of the camel driver in his hand. Behind him stalked the Contessa all in white from her snowy, floating veil to her spotless shoes (which didn't stay spotless), smoking one cigarette after another. The rest of us, ten in number, came on by twos and threes, looking perfectly commonplace in our ordinary donkey clothes. Over the burning sands we went under the burning sun, while the Arab in a loud clear voice recited a sort of incantation. And from the {24} thorn bushes of the desert he drew the snakes and never once when he would pounce on a rock and turn it over did he fail to find a scorpion. And the scorpions stung him and the snakes bit him, and then he would drop them into a strong basket with a weighted plug-like stopper to it, and a cord handle to carry it by. We lunched in one of the side rooms of the temple and when rested and comfortably full of bread and butter and sardines and pate de foie gras and cake and ginger ale and Turkish coffee, we rose up and demanded a cobra. It was against the rules to hunt for it in the temple, Maspero having forbidden it, but we did it. Through one great court we followed the Arab and his incantation, then into another, and when he began pushing his sleeves up to his shoulders we knew he smelled his quarry (that's what he does - he smells them). He stepped from ruined wall to ruined wall and suddenly bent forward with what sounded like a shout of command, and out from a crack between two great blocks of stone slid the wicked head of a cobra. With a jerk of his stick the Arab brought the four feet of reptile out and it slipped and curved over the pavement, then raised its head, spread its hood and struck. It didn't hit anything but I heard its jaws come together. Then the Arab picked it up and showed us its fangs and it struck again, leaving drops of poison on his sleeve. Then the Contessa took it and holding it tightly just back of the venomous head she put it around her neck. It was, to me, an absolutely revolting spectacle.She and Mr. Tremaine both wear charms that the Arab has given them. I asked Mr. Tremaine to tell me as man to man whether or not he believed in his charm. To which he replied that this much he knew - that not for anything would the Arab let any of the rest of us, who had no charm, handle the snakes which he permitted him and the Contessa to take hold of freely. His theory is that the charms are saturated with some kind of essence of snake which the snakes smell and which renders the wearers more or less immune. The show over we all ambled home in a rather spectacular train in the lovely sunlight across the Memnonian plain. And Cousin Theodore didn't believe a word of it.Wednesday, January 22. This afternoon I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace - mixed doubles. My partner was a very. nice Scotsman named MacNaughton, and we defeated English lords and German baronesses and commoners like ourselves, and won the first prize. And not a Yale athlete of them all can boast a cup like mine. It pursued me in a boat from the Winter Palace, for I had beaten a modest retreat, not knowing that I had won anything.Friday, June 24. Yesterday Doris and I had a lovely afternoon. Mrs. Pier had invited us over to the Winter Palace for the Gym Khana, and we sat and baked in the sunshine and were much amused watching the sports and the crowds of people. Luxor seems very full just now and there are two or three American dahabyas tied up on that side, though I don't know who is on them.Today, in the afternoon, Cousin T., Doris and I rode over to our new diggings at Medinet Habu. Harry began there yesterday and says he is glad to be working above ground. The children who were carrying off the dirt were all singing some sort of chant. "Have they been singing like that all day?" I asked. "Oh, no!" said Harry, "they are simply singing 'The Boss has come, the Boss has come.’”  The light was perfectly exquisite as it fell on Lybian Cliffs, on stately temple walls, on heaps of rubbish, on spots of trulyemerald verdure, on a lonely Coptic Monastery far off in the desert, and on one splendid Beduin swinging on his camel over the sands toward the western sun, twirling his camel stick in the air.Good-bye, dears all, till another week.       Your devoted Mary {25}Sunday, January 26.West Bank at LuxorDearest Adeline:- How does that Watts hymn go? "Oh day so calm, so still, so bright" - I don't believe I've got it right and very likely it wasn't Watts who perpetrated it, but anyway "so calm, so still, so bright" describes all our Sundays here (and all other days except when the wind blows). "So still" did not exactly depict the part ofthe morning when Mr. Whymper was breakfasting with us. He is awfully nice and very amusing - but Dio Mio! what a voice! The whole boat was filled with the sound thereof and I could see Cousin Theodore wilt beneath it. Rarely have I met anyone who dislikes as much as does Charles W. to have anyone else talk, so when he is present there is little respite from that battering sound. I'm beginning to understand why his lawful and wedded doesn't live with him, but resides somewhere in the country in England with the daughter, and occasionally allows Charles to pay them a visit. He and Doris and I rowed over to church together. Our regular incumbent was absent, preaching in the Cathedral at Khartoum, and we had two clerical birds of passage in his place. The sermon, an excellent one, was preached by the Rev. Urquhart Bing Urquhart (isn't that a delicious name?) And the service was read by a little man who looked like an owl but who had a charming voice and read beautifully. In connection with him Mr.Whymper told us such a nice little tale. He - the Rev. Owl (I forget his name) is rector in a little town in England called Dunmow (where General Bing, now commanding all the forces in Egypt, lives when he's at home). And there it has been a custom from time immemorial, to give once a year a whole flitch of bacon to the married couple who on that day can, with their hands upon the altar, swear solemnmly that for the preceding year not a single cross word has passed between them! If more than one couple present themselves and take this solemn oath, whichever one can best substantiate the assertion receives the flitch of bacon. Mr. Tremaine came home to luncheon with us and I'm sure had a very dull time. No - he didn't come with us, he followed later, and the Contessa was to have come with him but had a bad headache and couldn't, and he looked almost dismembered without her. Doris rode over to the diggings at Medinet Habu this afternoon with her donkey boy and a sailor. She and I had a lovely ride yesterday afternoon around by the Ramesseum and home by the Colossi, where we paused and got off to examine the creatures, which we have not done before. When we reached the Beduin we found Mrs. Pier and her two little girls. Those little girls are the very sweetest things I've seen in ages. They were having a heavenly time in our poultry yard as we rode up. Monday, January 27. I foresee that this letter is going to be dull for anyone to read, for I don't seem to be doing anything off the boat just now except society things. (I'm lunching out tomorrow and the next day). I literally did not step off the boat till late this afternoon when Cousin Theodore and I went on the sands for a walk which he thought long and I thought short. We were all to have gone over to the diggings this afternoon, Cousin Emma in her donkey chair and we on our mounts, but just as we were all ready to start Cousin T. said he had a headache and wouldn't go, so I stayed at home with him, and the others went. At teatime they returned in a sort of whirlwind of donkeys and people, having picked up the Contessa and Mr.Tremaine and their outrunners. And at the same time a boat drew up on the other side of the Beduin and deposited a very charming Englishwoman - a Mrs. Graham, whose husband belongs to the Civil Service in Egypt, and who is an old acquaintance of the cousins. Poor Cousin Theodore was reduced almost to a panic, as he always is nowadays by the arrival of people. I admired Mrs. Graham vastly, in spite of an absolutely expressionless way of speaking which I generally find irritating when I meet it. Something quite thrilling was told her by Mr. Tremaine, and she murmured in a perfectly colorless voice "How exciting" as she buried her nose in her teacup. {26}Tuesday, January 28. Harry came over early this morning (have I said that Tuesday is the weekly holiday here?) and took Doris on an expedition to Karnak. Mr. Howard Carter came from his diggings about eleven and stayed, politely quarreling with all of us, until time to escort Cousin Emma and me to the Dahabya Cheops, just below us, where he and we were lunching with the Fahnstocks.Mr. Howard Carter merits a paragraph to himself.  He is a young Englishman and one of the very best diggers in Egypt. He used to dig for Cousin Theodore until they quarreled (not politely, I fear). Now he digs for lord Carnarvon. He can be perfectly charming, I'm told. This morning he was probably liverish for he disagreed with everything that was said. Fleas were mentioned. He said there were no fleas in this part of Egypt! Cousin Emma then asserted that there were even worse things than fleas in this part of Egypt. He insisted on knowing what she meant. Goaded to desperation she finally replied succinctly "Flesh-lice". "You can't acquire those", said he, "they are parasites. The develop on the bodies of the persons who have them." "I've had them!" said the dainty little lady. "You can't have had them", asserted Mr. Carter. "Play that piece!" he said, pouncing on me as I was playing dominoes with Cousin T; it annoys me excessively to be watched when I'm playing dominoes, and more so to be ordered about during the process. So I played another piece and lost the game. "Why didn't you play the piece I told you to?" he demanded. (It was the first time I had ever talked to the man in my life.) "Because you told me to", I replied. Whereupon he laughed and began to be pleasant. The luncheon with the Fahnstocks was very agreeable, but with oceans too much to eat. I sat between an Italian Count - who is here buying up lands to start a Franciscan or Dominican (I don't know which) monastery, and Mr. Tremaine (the Contessa was at the other end of the table.) Mr. Tremaine is beginning to assume godlike proportions in my mind since he told me that "one of his homes" is in Cornwall and that he owns a magnificent cliff near Tintagel. Think of owning a piece of that rapturous coast! This evening Doris has, I'm happy to say, gone to dine with those lovely Piers at the Winter Palace and to stay for the dance afterwards. Wednesday, January 29.  Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings this morning and I mended frantically until time to put on my very swagger serge (made by Hamilton & Co. of Chapel St., and a credit to them) and go over to the Winter Palace to lunch with the Piers. The little girls lunched with us - as I hoped they would - and each one of them gave me a lovely pink rose. They looked like lovely pink roses themselves. Nothing on earth could be sweeter than they are. We had a charming time, and then I got a carriage and drove Mrs. Pier out to the American Mission School in which the Cousins have been so interested for years. Cousin T. always keeps seven orphan girls there. As soon as any are graduated others take their place. There are three American women teachers, a Scotch housekeeper and a number of native women teachers. The chief difficulty in the mechanism of the school is the feeding o fthe pupils - each meal has to be served in three sections, according to caste, and with different food for each caste. It's a fine new building extending around a square court, and most ofthe rooms are light and airy. They, the teachers, insisted upon our having tea with them and gave us some delicious Scotch shortcake and another kind qf cake - quite the best I've had in Egypt. Then I came home and had another tea, Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero being here for that function. He is surely one of the most delightful men in all the wide world. I fancy Lady M. is very agreeable when with people who can jabber French but she will not exert herself in the least for those who move haltingly through the mazes of the Gallic tongue. She allowed herself a moment of enthusiasm when we were hanging over the rail watching the ducks, who know as well as anyone when it's teatime. "Comme il est enorme, Ie gros!" was almost the only spontaneous remark I heard her make. In the middle of the Masperos' visit a steam launch came puffing and clattering up and a beautiful woman and her  {27} good-looking husband asked for me. They were Mr. and Mrs. Packard - she a niece of Mrs. William Farnam, and very like her. They were very rushed, being in Luxor for a few hours only, and I was so sorry not to see more of them.Thursday, Januaary 30. Doris and I had a lovely ride this afternoon. We went first over to the diggings to cheer Harry up a bit. He gets low in his mind if he doesn't see a white person to speak to occasionally. We went by a short cut which Doris loves and I hate because there's a fearsome plunge into a gully which I always descend shrieking "I want to get off - I want to get off! 0 how I loathe this place!" While a sailor holds me on and Malimond says in that heavenly voice of his "Don' be 'fraid Madame!" Yesterday the sailor and I took the plunge in a most lover-like manner, for I was clutching him around the neck and he had his arm around my waist. Harry clamored for us to stay, but we had a hankering to go somewhere we had not been before, so after a very big visit we continued on our way and finally - or should I say shortly - reached the hollow in the hills where nestles that gem of a temple (small enough for my limited comprehension) Der-el-Medineh.  Such lovely carving, such delicious color left in scraps and patches, and peace and remoteness that I said "I would have liked to come here to church".  And through a broad opening in the rocks a wide and beautiful view down to the distant Nile, with the stately ruin of the Ramesseum in the foreground. We had only fifteen minutes to spend there, but acquired that haunting desire to return there which is, for me, an Egyptian fever. The splendid looking Arab, guardian of the place, was so overcome by my largesse of seven and a half cents that he knocked Malimond out of the way in order to hold my donkey himself when I mounted. We rode home by our dear Colossi and Doris suddenly left me on a mad gallop to overtake a baby camel she saw in the distance. I finally caught it up without any undue exertion. I don't believe it could have been more than a month old. The maternal camel was not in the least gratified by our attentions and tried to take a bite out of Doris.Friday. January 31. The only thing worthy of record today was tea, by invitation, with the  Masperos on their Dahabya Miriam. It's a government boat and so ugly that I should think it would afflict them desperately to have to live on it. However, I come back from every other boat I see frehly impressed with the beauty and perfect order of this one. Sir Gaston was very twinkly this afternoon but did not have the opportunity to launch forth upon one of his marvelous monologues. We rowed home beneath a flight of crimson clouds with the upper reaches of the river rose and violet and the nearer ones fire opal. Good-bye till another week and so much love to all, whether in Edwards Street, on the dear hilltop, or in Summerville.        Your devoted Mary Sunday, February 2. West Bank at Luxor Dear Adeline:- There is such a wild wind from the desert tonight that the Beduin is rocking as she never did during the entire voyage up from Cairo. Always immediately after dinner I come into my room and hang out of my window for a few minutes to look at the stars and the lights of Luxor. Tonight they are veiled in sand. The wind rose in the afternoon. It was calm enough when Doris and I went to church this morning. Upon emerging from the sanctuary I had a little talk with Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Hutchins, Delia Porter'a relatives who are birds of passage through {28}  Luxor. We brought Miss Buchanan home to luncheon. She it is who built up the Mission School (the American Mission) at Luxor, and who is head now of the larger one in Cairo, and whom Cousin Theodore admires so profoundly. Everyone does, I think. A little, very plain little woman, whose "outward semblance doth belie her soul's immensity". The beauty of that soul makes itself apparent to all kinds of people. A Sheik from the desert who came to one of the Commencements at the Mission School here said to one of the teachers, in speaking of Miss Buchanan, "Today for the first time in my life have I seen a Woman! How can I go back to those three - my wives!"This afternoon the Fahnestocks came to tea and some English people named Rae puffed over in a steam Launch from Luxor, bringing Mohammed Mohassib. The old man enjoyed himself enormously, sat in various chairs, chuckling at everything, insisted on drinking tea, because it was the custom at this hour on this boat, though he disliked it greatly, and we were all telling him to wait a few minutes and he should have some coffee. We were disappointed because he wasn't clad.in rich raiment - he being a millionaire - but he was bundled up in a brown and white checked shawl around his neck and an old brown overcoat with a hood to it, such as our sailors wear at night.Monday, February 3. A heavenly day - like all the others that have gone before it. The wind ceased suddenly last night before it had tom us from our moorings, and this morning dawned as quietly as possible. Doris went over to Karnak for the forenoon with Margaret Fahnestock, and in the afternoon she rode out to the diggings with Cousin Theodore, while I spent the afternoon in the novel and thrilling occupation of falling in love with a Russian Princess. The Contessa had invited me to go to Karnak in a small party of which the Princess was one. We were to be shown about by M. Legrain himself (he has for years been conducting the excavations at Karnak). But that part fell through and it was Mme. Legrain who took us about, Legrain himself being absorbed with a dissipated looking Prince de Croix. But little I cared as long as I could gaze upon my Princess. Besides, I think we saw pretty much what we would have seen under Legrain's guidance.We watched the workmen carefully unearthing a large and beautiful jar from a ruined and crumbling wall beyond the sacred lake. We held our breaths while it was being emptied, and let them out again when nothing but a brick was found inside. We went to the little temple of Ptah in one dusky room of which stands the uncanny black granite statue of Sekmet, the goddess with the lion's head. When you have looked at her for five minutes she becomes so vibrant with life that it is easy to understand why the Arabs believe that she sometimes prowls forth seeking whom she may devour. My chief pleasure this afternoon was watching the Princess -a fairy Princess, young, little, beautiful, quiet, with a delightful laugh and a perfect simplicity of manner. She looks like a high bred Englishwoman except that her eyes are somehow different. Her skin is healthily tanned with a lively color in it. She wore a most perfect pongee skirt, just off the white in tone, shoes to match, a short silk sweater coat of tawny orange, a hat like all our hats (bought in Cairo for $1. 00) with a long veil, like all our veils only of a lighter shade than her sweater, a cane with a bloodstone sunk in the top of the handle, and a monocle on a black ribbon. She walked so well on her little feet and when she took off her gloves later at tea in the garden of the Luxor Hotel, her hands were covered with superb sapphires. Doris had seen her on the street in the morning, was insantly antagonized by the monocle, and came home saying she was "a sight" and that her donkey had shied at her. So much for the intolerance of youth. She is the Princess Gortschokoff and she has me bound to her chariot wheels.{29}Tuesday, February 4. Doris and I have had a perfect day. Harry elected to spend the holiday in the valley and invited Doris and me to come out to see the tomb of Horemheb, which neither of us had entered, and also that I might see the Siphtah sarcophagus, and then to lunch with him at the House. We got up early and had breakfast at eight (nine is the usual hour) and were off on our donkeys before the Cousins appeared. We rode via the landing place opposite Luxor and it was a sight worth seeing. Two steamers had come in last night and scores upon scores of people were bound for the valley and the hubbub and the color and the excitement! Scores and scores of donkeys with their gay trappings, scores and scores of donkey boys in blue and white and a dash of red on their chests, native policemen in khaki trying to keep order while their splendid camels lay waiting for them in the background - carriages, sand carts - and everybody shouting and talking at once. It was immensely amusing. I did enjoy my ride, and the light and the color on the Libyan Range were of surpassing beauty, but so blinding that we had to lower our chiffon veils. We rode first to the House, to drop our donkeys and pick up Harry, and then we walked around to the Valley of the Tombs. We went first into Horemheb which is not a very easy tomb to enter, as the once kingly flights of steps leading down into it are not but crumbling masonry. But what beauty of painted walls when once you have made the descent, and what a superb sarcophagus! More interesting to me than the completed work were the walls where the designs were sketched in merely, looking as though the artist had just laid down his crayon and his brushes and gone home to luncheon. Horemheb is lighted by electricity - but Siphtah more appropriately by reflected sunlight from a large mirror at the mouth. The chief interest in Siphtah is the sarcophagus. They've not got the lid turned over yet, but the thing is very impressive from its size. The inscriptions on it seemed to me to be done in rather an archaic manner, but Harry is of the opinion that that is because red granite is such a difficult medium.It was horribly hot walking back to the House in the fierce light of noon, but it's the sort of heat one can stand if one's head and the back of one's neck are covered. We had a very gay luncheon with Harry and Mr. Launcelot Crane, and a lovely ride home. As we passed Howard Carter's diggings we were surprised to see that he was working his full force of 300 in spite of its being the holiday. He was probably doing it under orders from Lord Carnarvon. That rather damaged nobleman was standing under an awning arrangement, leaning on his cane, surveying the proceedings. When we reached the Beduin the Contessa was here and eight other people came soon after. Two of them were the Masperos to say good-bye, as they start down the river in the morning. Sir Gaston tells me that my Princess is the granddaughter of the old and famous Prince Gortschokoff; that she is married to a commoner by whose name she is never called! My mind is absorbed tonight between my passion for my Princess and my interest in the strange habits of camels. I passed one on the road this afternoon, which hated me instantly, and in order apparently to express its utter loathing it threw up one of its stomachs and swallowed it again with the most perfectly horrid noise I ever heard. Wednesday, February 5. and Ash Wednesday too. I didn't go to church, but it was a self-denial not to, so I hope it's all right. The only exciting thing that has happened today was when a sailboat drew up at the side of the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet, friends of Doris's and mine, whom we had supposed were at home in Cleveland, Ohio. I followed them back in my boat to call on Mrs. Dodge. They are on their way up the River on one of Cook's steamers. Thursday, February 8. {NOTE  WRONG DATE} and an entirely heavenly day as usual. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode out to the diggings, and Cousin Emma and I donned our war paint, crossed over to Luxor and took a carriage. We had some difficult  in getting a nice looking one, because Mr. J. P. Morgan has arrived in his dahabya and he keeps six carriages and six donkeys waiting all day long on each {30} side of the river in case he may want them. We drove out to Karnak to call on Mme. Legrain, who says her husband is nearly dead showing princes and potentates about the ruins. We also called on Mrs. Edgar but didn't see her. When we got back to Luxor cousin Emma came straight home and I paused to refresh myself with tea and Mrs. Pier and to see the throngs at the Winter Palace. Our haughty seclusion on the west bank is well enough in the long run, but I do like once in a while to be in the thick of things. Friday, February 7. and an almost disagreeable day because of the wind. We meant to ride out to the diggings, but the air was so thick with sand that Doris and I decided to keep to the waterway - so we sailed up the Nile in the little felucca with four of the crew and enjoyed it immensely. Farewell, dears all. With love and devotion       Mary February 15. West Bank, Luxor Dearest Adeline:- This letter ought really to be skipped and all of you may skip it without hurting my feelings in the very least. Since my last, the Land of Egypt has been the House of Bondage to me - the past week having been an unpleasant medley of broken engagements, frustrated plans, homesickness and sciatica. At least I suppose sciatica is the gentle distemper that makes one's left leg feel as though it had been skinned alive and all the muscles tom out slowly with hot forceps. I've managed not to stay in bed and I've also managed to play dominoes, but I've not been up to anything else, and in my off hours have shut myself up in my room, swathed in knitted things and packed with hot water bags, and saying "Hame, hame, fain wad I be, Hame, hame in my ain countree." To cap the climax we are actually having bad weather. It is now three days since the sunshine has been wholly withdrawn and day before yesterday it actually rained all day; fortunately only a gentle sprinkle - had it been a good New Haven downpour the mud village opposite us would have dissolved before our eyes. On Monday I was to have gone on a picnic to the Valley of the Queens with the Contessa and Mrs. Pier, but Doris went in my place. On Tuesday I was to have teaed with Mrs. Daniel Eaton, way up the river on the Arabia, but had to send a note saying I was too crippled to come. I hope she will carry out her plan of spending a week on her way down. The other day Doris rode with Dorothy Richardson over to the abode near Der-el-Bahri which is called indifferently "the American House" or "Mr. Morgan's House", and in which live the men who are managing the Metropolitan excavations, and the wives of said men. When the girls got there at ten o'clock the people were just about to have breakfast! As digging stops at four-thirty they must have a short day at the Metropolitan Concession. Mr. Morgan's eccentric behavior has caused a buzz of comment and conjecture. During the two or three days his dahabya lay here the people at the American House spent their time in moving into tents and back again according to messages from the Great Man as to whether he was or was not going out there to occupy. He finally did not go. He had a party often on his boat whom he had invited to go to Khartoum and somehow it leaked out that their lives were a burden to them because their host was so cross and tyrannical. The Khartoum plan was suddenly abandoned and they merely tore up to Aswan and back again, being gone only four days. Then Mr. Morgan engaged suites of rooms at the Winter Palace for his party and before they had time to move into them he whisked them all down to {31} Cairo this morning in a special train. The Contessa, who was over here this afternoon, says Mohammed Mohassib almost fainted when she told him this morning that his prey had escaped him and that he might now bring forth his treasures and let other people have a chance at them.Ex-President Porfirio Diaz, with a boatload of "greasy looking Mexicans" (I'm quoting my daughter) has recently been tied up in front of Luxor. Dahabyas come and go and the Stars and Stripes seem to preponderate at the mast heads.And now I will end this weak decoction and crave everyone's indulgence.       Your devoted Mary Sunday, February 16.West Bank at Luxor Dearest Adeline:- Today we could once more say joyfully, with the fire-worshippers, "Lo! the Lord Sun!" And if we had been without it for a month we could hardly have welcomed it more gladly. Egypt would be an intolerable land if it were often gloomy weather. I'm sure everyone would go mad and drown himself and herself and themselves in Old Nile. Doris went to church alone this morning and brought back the Contessa to luncheon. She stayed a long time, and after Cousin Theodore and Doris had gone for their ride, she held Cousin Emma and me enthralled, as the three of us sat in the sunshine on deck, with the story of her first husband's experiences and death in Central Africa, whither he went with Stanley. When she had finished I felt literally tired from my emotions. It was like a Henry Seton novel for interest and quite ghastly and heart-rending. When I come home I'll tell the story to anyone who wants to hear it, but I do not want to write it. The one time I laughed this afternoon was at a scene on the bank. The black dog and the yellow dog, who have constituted themselves guardians of the Beduin for the sake of the food they get, started to fight and were stopped by the turkey cock who, with all his feathers spread and gobbling furiously, rustled in between them. It was really one of the funniest things I ever saw.Monday, February 17. Nothing much to record today except a furious wind which at one time this morning seemed as though it would tear us from our moorings and blow us across the river. After luncheon I left the boat for the first time in eight days and crossed over to Luxor in the sailing felucca (and a dashing little sail it has) to see if an electrical treatment would relieve the ache that had possession of me. I think it did somewhat. It felt good at the time anyway. Luxor looked almost new to me - it had been so long since I saw it. The Hardys came to tea; they are very agreeable, but it is much easier to imagine Mr. Hardy leading a diplomatic life than Mrs.Tuesday. I missed a great treat today because of my rheumatism. Harry Burton invited Mr. and Mrs. Pier and Doris and me over to the valley to luncheon and to see the sarcophagus lid in Siphta which has at last been turned over under the supervision of one of Maspero's experts from the museum. The Piers and Doris went and had a gorgeous time. The lid is something unknown in the history of sarcophagi. There are four figures carved in relief upon it - the King is the central figure and there is a little child at each shoulder. Then on one side of him is Isis, on the other Nephtys, and scattered about somewhere are a crocodile and a snake.After my luncheon I crossed to Luxor for electricity and on coming back found Doris had just returned and was sitting on deck with Newton Byers, one of Roger's classmates, who has been dragged, an unwilling victim, to Egypt by his family. They are on their way up the river on the {32} Rameses III. Senator Aldrich came to tea and gave us some authentic information as to the cause of Mr. Morgan's erratic behavior. He says Mr. Morgan was far from well and was greatly disappointed in his new dahabya "Kargeh" because she was so slow, and that everything seemed to go wrong, and he got tired of the whole business and dashed back to Cairo. Wednesday, February 19. Today I had a distinct sensation. I went over this afternoon to the Rameses III to call on Mrs. and Miss Byers, whom I found very pleasant - Miss Byers struck me as being a quite rare and lovely person - and while there I saw no less a person than Rudyard Kipling. It seemed so strange that that little (he's very short) commonplace looking man should be packed with such extraordinary genius. I went on from the Rameses to the Winter Palace to have tea with Mrs. Pier and Madam Legrain, and then home. And tonight Doris dined on the Rameses with the Byers and then drove with them to Karnak to see that wondrous place in the moonlight. She says it surpassed any moonlight vision she ever heard or dreamed of.Thursday, February 20. The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the Contessa and grateful warmth. The Contessa invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the Luxor Hotel garden. It must be 15 or 20 degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the sun to annihilate my aches. The Luxor Hotel itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the Contessa chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. Morgan's departure without even a look at things that had been saved for him for weeks. It was at Hassan's at the end of our rounds, that I saw the only things I really wanted. It's surprising how ephemeral many of one's desires prove themselves if one refrains from plunging into buying the moment one gets to a strange place. Dozens of things I thought fascinating when I first began to look about the shops, I now pass with averted gaze because they tire me so. But Hassan brought out ten little alabaster jars (tumbler shaped) with a cartouche sunk in the side of each and colored blue, and an alabaster cover to each the size and shape of a large cream peppermint, and I coveted them with my whole heart. But the price of even one of the darling things was too much for me. Hassan's shop is quite a mansion with all his treasures on the second floor. You mount a flight of stone stairs which would be imposing if it were not for the traces of many chickens, and while you are poking about among the antiques a tiny page in red and white brings you coffee, of the best, in dainty cups. I brought the Contessa home with me for tea.Friday, February 21. And a perfectly commonplace day. Calls with Cousin Emma this afternoon and tea at the Winter Palace, which seems to be more or less packed with freaks at present - ladies who wear thin white dresses with no petticoats and pose in the doorway with miles of Egyptian sunlight behind them. On our way back to the Beduin the felucca was caught in the wash from the Aswan boat just coming down the river, and from the deck of it Mr. and Mrs. Dodge and Janet waved.Washington's Birthday.- and a nice American day as befits an American on February 22 wherever she happens to be. I played dominoes all the morning and in the afternoon I crossed over to Luxor, ordered a carriage, annexed those enchanting Pier children and drove out to the Savoy to call on Mrs. Daniel Eaton. As we passed along the waterfront - "Children" said I, "do you know why all the American boats are dressed in flags today?" "No", said the sweet little voices. "You don't know what day this is?" "No", expectantly and excitedly. "Why, it's Washington's Birthday". "Oh, is it? Why, I don't believe Father and Mother know it." "Then you must tell them when we get back". Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle were out, and we drove back again all too soon. As {33} we again passed the patriotic display of bunting that adorable Eleanor Pier, aged seven, said "Whose birthday is this? Did you say it was President Taft's?"The Dodges joined me at the Winter Palace and we had tea on the rear terrace, and it was awfully nice to be with friends from my native state. Doris and Janet Dodge had spent the whole morning together at Karnak, so Doris thought she would better ride to the diggings with Cousin T. instead of coming to tea. Now I'm going to wind up with two nice, appropriate little tales. Two or three years ago when on the 22nd of February the Beduin was in her gala dress to do honor to the day, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, coming down the river from Aswan, thought it was in their honor, and did everything except fire a salute to express their appreciation of the attention! And once in the days when my relatives had that superb dragoman Mohammed Sala (that was before Jones had qualified as a dragoman) he was much offended that he had not been informed the day beforehand that this important anniversary was pending. Hearing someone say at the breakfast table "This is Washington's Birthday - the boat must be dressed", he hurried out. Returning he said to Cousin Emma "Madam, the cook say it is not possible to prepare a fitting luncheon for the day without some notice." "I didn't want a special luncheon - the cook gives us too much to eat always, as it is", said Madam. At the close of luncheon, entered Mohammed Sala, bearing a colossal cake with the American flag in colored frosting on it. He placed it on the table and with a look of deep reproach at Cousin Emma, he announced "Le gateau pour Mr. Washington!" I had the pleasure of seeing Mohammed Sala today. On getting into the felucca after leaving the Winter Palace, the men held it while beckoning and calling to someone on the neighboring boat. Then Sala came hurrying along the bank, stepped into the felucca and bowed low over my hand. He said he was here "with one prince". After an exchange of compliments he departed. He is usually with important people. He was twice with the Empress of Austria, and she nearly killed him walking out to the Pyramids from Cairo and back every morning before breakfast.        Goodnight, dears all,        Your devoted Mary Monday,February 24. West Bank at LuxorDearest Adeline:- The Contessa and I had planned to go on a picnic a deux to the tombs of the Nobles today, but at breakfast time a boat brought a note saying a heavy cold on her chest prevented her going. As I had on my hateful riding things (never donned except for my donkey) I decided to take a ride anyway. Neither Doris nor Cousin Theodore would go with me, so I went alone, quite thrilled because it was the first time in fifteen days that I had ridden. It was the dullest ride I ever had. Wadi Haifa needed the inspiration of others of his kind. We started off with Malimond tugging at his head and a sailor pushing from behind. Shouts, cluckings, gurglings had no effect whatever on him. Whacks simply made his hindquarters go suddenly sideways in the disconcerting movement that almost unseats me. It took me an hour to get out to the Colossi, so there I turned about, relinquishing the Valley of the Queens for which I was headed and which I've not yet seen. If Malimond and the sailor had even talked to each other it would have been less depressing. I kept getting sadder and sadder and Egypt began to seem to me a lonely land of Doom, when I was suddenly cheered by the sight of a camel loaded with trunks and making for the American House. A camel can always pluck me out of melancholy. It was very hot coming home and I had to keep my veil down to prevent breathing tiny black flies. {34}This afternoon Cousin Emma and I, in response to the Contessa's importunities, went over and teaed with her in the Luxor Hotel gardens. She was very hoarse and the ground was very damp, but the sunshine lovely, the tea delicious and there were three other guests, quite charming - Lady Baring, Mrs. Murray and the Countess Pauline Pappenheim. I talked to the latter all the time, and I'm thankful I don't fall in love with men as easily as I do with women. The Countess Pauline is a girl after my own heart - about Doris's age, I should think, and with a very noble sort of beauty, and too sweet. She told me she was half American - that her mother was a Philadelphian, but I don't know who. And all this time I've been skipping yesterday which may be briefly summarized as follows: The boisterous Mr. Whymper came to breakfast. (I've decided all that excitable volubility is his company manner, because when he crosses over with Doris and me in the felucca on our way to church he is quite pleasantly quiet, and his face in repose is sad.) I went to church and after service had a little talk with Mrs. Daniel Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle for whom I waited outside 'the door. Brought Mr. and Mrs. Pier home with me for luncheon. They grow more and more  delightful. Two English ladies came to tea - Mrs. Morhouse, hushed and gentle and sweet - and Mrs. Aylmer, who might easily be colonel of a regiment. I believe her husband is. Yesterday was the warmest day we've had, I think, and today there has been a touch of Khamseen - the hot, thick wind of Egypt. It made the sunset tonight one of opaque, almost suffocating gold.Tuesday, February 25. The comings and goings today have been crowded. Doris and I dashed across the river immediately after breakfast to buy Soudanese beads together, and then I dashed back again, leaving her to play with Dorothy Richardson. Just after I returned to the Beduin, Harry arrived for his holiday, courteously wearing the necktie I crocheted for his Christmas present. He presently crossed over to have his hair cut and pick up Doris. I was in the middle of a game of dominoes when I heard a voice on the land side of us demanding "Is anybody at home? Is anybody at home? Is Mrs. Newberry in?" and Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle descended from a sand cart and entered via the gangplank. They'd been to the Ramesseum - or somewhere. A brief visit and they departed after I'd shown them over the dahabya. Then Harry and Doris came. Luncheon next. After which the two young people went for a sail. About 4 P.M. who should arrive - taking my breath away with the violence of the surprise - but Karl Weston (Professor of Romance Languages at Williams) whom I last saw twelve years ago when we took tea together in a chestnut tree at that queer place "Robinson" outside of Paris. Close on heels came Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson, who had been asked to tea. Cousin Theodore went below and couldn't see anybody. Then at 7:15 Doris, in her war paint, went across the river to dine and dance at the Winter Palace - so it's been almost as hectic as some of the days at home...Doris just back at 11.30 and says she Bostoned most ofthe evening with Newton Byers - of 1912 Sheff - and saw the family of that Perfect Beauty, Radcliffe Romeyn, 1912 Captain of the Yale Crew.Wednesday, February 26. I called this afternoon on the Romeyns on their steamer and was very glad to see them, but was freshly impressed with how awful it would be to go about in a Cook's party - infinitely better though than not to go at all. Mrs. Romeyn said she had almost despaired of seeing us because the only information Radcliffe could give her of our whereabouts when she bade him good-bye, was that we "were travelling with some big bug on a private dahabya that tied up anywhere it pleased along the Nile". They go on to Aswan tomorrow. I teaed at the Winter Palace with Mr. Weston and had a lovely time. That is a most congenial young man, and it seems absurd, when he lives in Williamstown and we in New Haven, that we should meet only once in ten years or so in the top of chestnut trees in Paris, or at Hundred Gated Egyptian Thebes. {35} I wonder if it's often given to human eyes to see anything more beautiful than the Libyan Range was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the Winter Palace today in all the splendor and the glamour of the late afternoon light. It strikes me with fresh joy every time I look at it from that particular place and at that hour. The Beduin has sunk so with the falling river that from the salon we can no longer see even the tip-top of the Range, and even from the upper deck we do not get it in its full majesty as they do from the Winter Palace. When we first tied up here we could see the Range and all the intervening stretch of desert and green from the salon window - which will give you some idea of how the river has dropped. When I got back to the Beduin I found Mrs. Pier and the Countess having tea. They had stopped on their way home from an all day expedition to the Valley of the Tombs of the Apes. They had asked Doris and me to go, but we declined because Cousin T. was not feeling well. Thursday, February 27. This morning Cousin Emma and Doris went over to Luxor to see Mohammed Mohassib and the Luxor temple, etc. while Cousin Theodore and I settled ourselves with the dominoes on deck. In the middle of a game the sound of many bleats arose upon the air - ranging from deep paternal ones to tiny appealing baby calls, and over the sands came a flock of dark brown sheep with four men and some children shepherding them. They came straight to the little cove just at the stern of the Beduin. Three of the men stripped to the loincloth, and each grabbed a sheep and walked into the river to wash it, while the children and the fourth man kept the rest of the flock together, and one small naked boy wrestled with a ram. It was a very interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman, who spends his day over here to see that no one steals our turkeys, strolled up and ordered them away from the sacred precincts of the dahabya.This afternoon Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings and I went for a long walk. My Monday attempt proved that my leg is still too lame for riding. Away to the north, standing in a row in the most obvious and posterish manner, with the far end of the Range as a background, are three palm trees. They look exactly like the funny pictures of the African desert with an artist up in one of them while a lion lashes his tail in front of a deserted easel below. Cousin Emma says she has hated those palm trees for years, and even I have got deadly tired of them this winter. So I walked to them to see if I liked them better at close range. The first part of the walk led along the sands by the river's edge where the natives are planting their melons. Vast stretches of little hillocks, with short bunches of dry cane in them to keep the sand together, show where melons have already been planted, and little oblong bunches, about the size of a large watermelon, show where others are to be planted. There ought to be an enormous crop in this immediate vicinity alone. Then I struck inland past a native village which has always looked so charming in the distance and which was very squalid really. Along a little ridge broken by shadufs and a complaining sakiheh around which a cow toiled. I like them best when a camel is working them. Camels always look so absolutely superior to anything they may be doing. I heard such a nice reason the other day for the superciliousness of the camel. Allah has one hundred names - the Faithful know ninety-nine of them but the camel knows the hundredth!...Then I cut across a cultivated little gully, climbed up the other side and, behold, the three palm trees, looking quite lovely and presiding over the very verdant outskirts of a tiny village. I came back another way and was ready for quarts of tea when I got here. {36}Friday. February 28. And our last day here until we stop on our way down to Cairo. I went across to Luxor this morning to say good-bye to Mrs. Pier and have a final scalp treatment. The tonic they apply is made, they say, from the juice of the palm tree. This morning when the German youth who has had recent charge of my sparse tresses dabbed on said tonic, I exclaimed "Oh! that stings!" "Yes, madam, it is de stink of de palm" was his apt rejoinder.Cousin Emma and I had a wondrous drive this afternoon. Neither she nor I had been to the diggings at Medinet Habu for weeks. When we announced we were going Cousin T. said he did not wish us to as we would interfere with the work. He and Doris go over every other day, but when we suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything. We took the felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carriage with two mules awaited us, and I was internally much amused when Cousin Emma gave the driver the simple order "Medinet  Habu", for the Valley of the Queens was supposed to be our object. But we were crazy to see the things Harry had excavated since our last visit - namely the palace of Rameses III. We found Harry trying to take a photograph, while his hundred boys and men proceeded on their endless procession to the dumping place. The throne room and three bathrooms are what have, thus far, been brought to light. As the bathrooms open directly off the throne room, to the casual and frivolous eye it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne and a washing of hisself. On our way to our carriage we were held up by a native who produced a bandana tied up in a wad from which he took out four little carved bone images, which he told us, in a scared whisper, came from Lord Carnarvon's diggings. Cousin Emma wished to buy them for Doris, but had forgotten her purse. The man agreed to take the entire contents of mine, though it fell short of the ten shillings he asked. When too late we realized that this transaction left us with no backshis for anybody. On we went to the Valley of the Queens - a lovely desert drive, and to my eye a much happier valley than that of the Kings, because of the wide and beautiful view from its entrance away down to the river and on to the far Arabian Mts. On our arrival at the tombs and upon being confronted by the gaffir, we remembered we'd left our passes at home. But the magic name of Davis opened the way. But then we fell back in the carriage explaining we had no backshis. Broad smiles on the face of the gaffir and a courteous assurance that that made no difference. I wanted mainly to see the tomb of Nefertari so I went into that, and if that Queen was as lovely as her pictures on those walls, Rameses II must have been crazy about her.The drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh, so calm, so scented, the barley fields such a rejoicing green, everything so beautiful in the ecstatic light of afternoon. The river reached, no backshis for the driver, but he was quite satisfied when we told him Mr. Jones would attend to that (Jones is almost as much a name to conjure by as Davis. Also there was no felucca, we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us!A Winter Palace boat clamored for the honor of taking us to our dahabya, brutally pushing aside one lone tourist wishing to cross to said Palace. Just started in the Winter Palace boat, up dashed our own felucca, the men rowing like mad, and we were transferred, the Winter Palace boatmen perfectly satisfied when we said Mr. Jones would see them. The whole expedition was awfully amusing.Saturday. On our way up the River. We "hit the trail" (as we used to say in my beloved wild west) at 7:20 this morning, and it was high time for us to be moving, for Cousin Theodore was getting tired of Luxor and very low in his mind. And again Doris and I are in the clutch of the enchantment of these wonderful shores slipping by us. Everybody is planting melons, even on the sandbars in the middle of the river. I should think that later on the entire population would be writhing with colic. {37} I don't know just where this will. be posted but it will seize its first opportunity.       Much, much love to you all.        Your devoted Mary Saturday, March 2. The Nile, Somewhere above Edfu Dearest Adeline:- If the frogs made as much noise in Pharoah's bedroom as they are making outside of mine tonight I wonder he did not let the people go sooner. I never heard anything like it. And just this minute the voice of a jackal was added to the row that has been going on every second since 6:30 - it now being half-past ten. Yesterday, after I finished my letter to you, we had an excitement. We were going through the great bridge at Esneh when our tug made too sharp a turn before the dahabya got clear of the tremendous piers or buttresses or whatever they are called. Everybody up above on the bridge watching our transit began to jump and yell, the crew came flying up on deck like the wind and leaped like cats on the railing to try to push us off as we rounded and crashed against the buttress. Second Captain Mahommed, as he flung his whole weight on his tiller, looked like a raging devil - and undoubtedly has one inside of himself There was not much damage done - some paint removed and a few splinters, but that was alL And none of the crew hurt - to our great relief - I thought one man was going to be mashed. The rest ofthe afternoon's voyage "up south" as they say in this land of contradictions, proceeded in peace with such exquisite beauty round about us that I wished I had been constructed "full of eyes before and behind" like the Beast in Revelations. The ineffable light and color filled the very air - like music. One new feature in the landscape was the stockade-like structures made of dry stalks (stalks of the dhurra, I fancy) put down along the sunny side of the shadufs to protect the workers a little from the glare. We must have passed hundreds of shadufs yesterday and today. They must weaken the bank greatly. This morning we heard a piece of the bank detach itself with a boom like a cannon and drop into the Nile. We stopped at Edfu today so that Doris and I might see the temple. We started this morning from our tying up place (the other side of EI Kab) before sunrise, but ran on to a sandbar and were much delayed, and it was luncheon time when we reached Edfu. As soon as we had lunched Doris and I started, climbing a very steep and dusty bank, covered with chicken feathers, at the top of which donkeys were awaiting us. Just how it is managed to always have donkeys or carriages ready for us I don't know, but it always is. It's Jones, I suppose. Beside the usual foot escort of donkey boys and a sailor we had a mounted one consisting of Haneen and a native policeman. There was nothing attractive about the ride, which took only ten or fifteen minutes, and the heat was fierce. But the temple is perfectly stunning; probably the best preserved ancient monument in the world, Baedecker says. The gaffir who showed us over the temple explained that its excellent state was due to its being "so modern" - dating from 237 B.C! In one of the ten small chambers opening from the corridor surrounding the Sanctuary is a granite sacrificial stone and he told us a tale concerning it which we can find in none of the guide books. He said that upon that stone were slain such people as were unfortunate enough to have one red lock of hair among the dusky ones. “If man have one lock red hair he bad man" he said. We saw the Nilometer outside the temple and we climbed to the roof of the temple, where it was hotter than pepper but the view from which made it quite worth while. The donkey I rode was the most heavenly animal I've ever been on - a big, handsome grey Sudanese donkey with a gait so smooth he hardly seemed to be moving. I would like nothing {38}better than to buy him and take him home. Conventions are such deadly stupid things - Doris and Roger would almost as soon have me dead as to see me riding about New Haven on a donkey covered with red tassels, and yet it would give me such keen pleasure and be such pleasant, moderate exercise. We got back to the Beduin at three and proceeded upon our lovely, watery way.Monday, March 3. It has been a perfectly horrid day with a lovely ending to it, and just one pleasant incident in the horrid part. No sooner had we started this morning than we stuck on a sandbar  -that is, our tug stuck. As the Beduin draws only 14 inches of water she never sticks on anything. When we finally got off there were five other boats (native ones - high and dry on the same bar. It was a grey morning and the air heavy and enervating. As we went through the gorge of Silsileh we had an excellent view of the rock-hewn chapel of Horem-heb with its five doors and that curious row of shrines, also rock-hewn, with the figures in them looking, as Miss Edwards. says in her "Thousand Miles up the Nile", like people sitting in opera boxes. And then a perfectly dreadful wind blew up and lashed the river into a fury of waves and whitecaps, and the air was full of sand and the landscape was more or less blotted out, and every bit of energy evaporated from me. At about one we tied up just above Kom Ombo, both because Doris and I were to see the temple, and also because navigation was too disagreeable.There is a bank towering above us here where we are tied, and though the Beduin jerked and strained most of the afternoon, we were out of the direct path of the wind. Doris and I decided to wait till after tea before going to the temple, in hopes that the wind would fall - which it did. The one pleasant incident above referred to was a visit from a tiny black kid with long flopping white ears. He announced himself with some baby bleats and then trotted across the gangplank on to the lower deck. We went out to see him; and he liked us so much that he kept coming back every time the sailors herded him off the gang plank to the shore.After tea Doris and I took Haneen and a sailor, climbed the bank, and two minutes walk along the top of it brought us to the temple. The hour we spent there put us in tune again. It has the unusual interest of being a duplex temple. If you drew a line straight through the center from front to back you would have on each side of that line a complete temple with forecourt, hypostile halls (large and small), vestibules, sanctuary and chambers, and the one on the right hand side is dedicated to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk; and on the left, to Hornar or Horceris (the Elder Horns). The first thing we saw on entering the forecourt was a little chapel in one room of which is a pile of mumrnied crocodiles - quite shuddery. The temple is very ruinous, and the reliefs, carved over every inch of it have departed from the pure, conventional lines of the best Egyptian art and go in for realism with a result that is rather fat and unpleasant. Its chief glory in our eyes is its site - directly on the edge of the Nile on the summit of a bank so lofty that it would be a cliff if it were of rock, but being of earth, has had to be strongly reinforced to keep the whole temple from gradually washing away at the time of the inundation. The views from the interior, out through the splendid columns, of the river and the limitless desert beyond, are a wonder and a joy. We climbed far up on a ruined pylon and sat there watching the gleaming river far below, the wisteria tint spreading over the sands of an island now void of the crocodiles that once infested it, a long line of people going home to a village on the far shore, and then the sun sinking behind the dim, dim, distant ridges of my beloved Libyan Mountains. And with the sinking of the sun the cloudy sky flamed into splendor. Somehow it all made me think of "the glory that was Greece" quite as much as of the brutal majesty that was Egypt.Tuesday, March 4. Aswan. We did not spend the night on the pylon, though I see I made no mention of our coming down. We left Kom Ombo before we were up this morning, in a heavy {39} wind, a turbulent river and a thick grey atmosphere. We passed a mile of flamingoes standing in serried ranks upon the sands, and it was a marvelous sight, though owing to the mistiness of the morning we could not see their color. It was very cold and the land looked very dreary and nowhere as beautiful as at Luxor. We arrived at luncheon time and wound a tortuous way among the titanic chaos of strange rocks that break the channel here, until we found a tying up place by a little sandy island opposite the Cataract Hotel and near Elephantine. We cavalierly pushed a small fishing fleet out of the cove we wanted, and if the language was as lurid as it was loud they must have "cursed us out" quite thoroughly. The ducks nearly died with rapture when their coop was opened and the river was once more theirs. And the chicken boy was kept busy tearing over to other coves to shoo them back. Sir Francis and his ladies are born explorers.After luncheon Doris and I, with Amelie, Haneen and a sailor to see that nobody stole us, went over (via the felucca) to the town and walked along the waterfront which is in itself much more attractive than the one at Luxor. And the whole region is much more strange and wild and savage, though much less majestically beautiful. The sun had come out, the air was fine and bracing and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. To see the bazaar was what we really went for and we were mad about it - not nearly so large of course as the one at Cairo, but - like the country - so strange and savage with such bewildering things for sale - most of which we wanted. The leopard skins filled me with covetousness, but are very expensive. I envied a Frenchman who had a beauty under his arm as he stood bargaining for a stuffed crocodile. Haneen is an admirable adjunct to shopping in the bazaars. He laughs sardonically whenever a merchant mentions a price and if we really want the article he jabbers something in the vernacular, thrusts half the sum demanded into the outstretched hand, and walks off with the amber beads or the dervish knife or the Soudanese basket, and is allowed to go in peace. It's very cold here and we expected to sizzle with heat.Thursday, March 5. Today Doris and I saw one of the wonders of the world - the great Aswan Dam, which seemed to me an incredible achievement of engineering. We started immediately after breakfast, taking a carriage at the Cataract Hotel, and with Haneen to carry our wraps and the luncheon basket and do our talking. We plunged almost instantly from that highly civilized hotel courtyard and gardens into an utterly desperate desert - a truly terrible place with none of the beauty of the desert at Luxor. The ruined little habitations, the ruined little cemeteries, the strange rocks with inscriptions scattered here and there, only added in my eyes to the general horror of the desolation. There were about three miles of that and then, again with complete abruptness, we found ourselves in a charming little oasis of a compound, with neat and pretty bungalows, lovely trees and gardens and verdant terraces - the little village where the government employees connected with the dam live. We walked across the barrage, a mile and a quarter, and the little talking we did was done in exclamations. On one side, within eight feet of the top of the barrage, lay the Nile in a placid lake. On the other, at least a hundred feet below, through a very few of the 180 sluices the water thundered and leapt and boiled almost like Niagara at the base of the falls, and then spread itself out in many streams that flowed among the numberless wild masses of strange rocks that make up the riverbed in that region. And stretching on all sides the sand ridges of that fearful desert, sinister and with a look of eternal doom - the very edge of Savage Africa.At the far end of the barrage we took a crazy little felucca and sailed to Philae. Alas for that poor, drowned "Pearl of Egypt"! We stepped out of our boat on to the roof of the temple, the tops of a few palm trees were apparently floating on the water which lapped the very capitals of the columns of that perfect kiosk. A keening and wailing came from one of the islands, and boats were hastening towards it filled with women who looked like black crows. Haneen said there was {40} "died man" on the island. We had to row back as the two men managing the boat were afraid to sail her in a fierce and contrary wind, which incidentally fairly blew our luncheon out of our mouths. It was such heart-breaking work, the rowing, that I made the men land us on a sandy point some distance from our destination. And I would not have missed a close inspection of that sand for much. It was turquoise blue and golden yellow. I don't expect to be believed, and if Doris hadn't seen it too, I would have thought I had gone color mad. We came home in a boat rowed by savages, one of whom beat upon a drum made of a hide stretched over a broken water jar, and sang wild ditties of his tribe I should imagine. The tiller of the boat was managed by a black baby aged about five. Shortly after we started on our downward voyage there shot out from a cove three tiny boats made of tin, in each of which sat a coal black little boy, two of whom were naked and the third jauntily attired in a turban and very short waistcoat. They paddled their .crafts with tin disks, one in each hand. They pursued us madly demanding backshish, which of course they got. It has been a marvelous expedition.Thursday, March 6. The wind apparently blows all the time at Aswan and dries one up so you have to use pounds of cold cream. We shifted our position this morning, leaving the channel between Elephantine and the Cataract House, and moving over to the other side of Elephantine and tying up opposite the Grenfell tombs. The felucca took us over there after luncheon - Doris and me - and two of the sailors helped us to climb the rather terrific flight of steps to the tombs. The tombs are so simple and crude and archaic and different that we found them very interesting. But the glorious views we had afterwards interested me much more. We live so low down in our dahabya that I'm beginning to have a frantic craving for heights. So, the tombs duly visited, we went on with our climbing. Doris and her sailor climbed to the very top and saw "hundreds of miles" she said - off over the desert. My left leg still being somewhat stiff I stopped when part way up and sat on a ruined wall on a spur of the hill and gazed down upon river and town and desert, many sunburned naked native towns, one perfectly superb sycamore tree, a train of camels on a beach near the steamer landing, and a fleet of snowy sails racing down the Nile. We were sorry we didn't stay longer, for when back on the Beduin the wind made the deck untenable and drove us below. We are off early tomorrow morning without having set foot on Elephantine! I rejoice to think of the long river trip before we finally reach Cairo.        Love and love and love, my dears        Your devoted Mary Sunday, March 9. West Bank at Luxor again.Dearest Adeline:- Here we are once more, not exactly in the old spot, because we found that usurped by an English dahabya - so we had to tie up a couple of boat lengths above. We arrived about 10:30 this morning and it is all so beautiful. Doris and I love this part ofthe river much more than those wild a lonely stretches near Aswan, and nowhere since we left here, eight days ago, have we seen anything as superb as the Libyan Range. We left Aswan early Friday morning with optimistic expectations of a smooth and rapid trip, having the current with us to aid our good little tug. But it was a case of sitting on sandbars every little while, with a head wind that was a gale and so heavy a "sea" on that it actually got too exciting, and so we sought as sheltered a spot as we could find and tied up about luncheon time in wait till the wind should fall. I took a walk early in the afternoon but Doris declared such a proceeding much too energetic for her. Through Haneen, as interpreter, I announced to the Rais (Arabic for Captain) that as I was only going to walk on the sands on the river's edge I did not want a sailor, and on I went. After walking some distance a slight sound made me look behind and there was the dandy of the crew (he who buys a {41} new set of rings every other week to wear upon his tattooed hands) dogging my steps. Discovered, he drew nearer and practiced his English upon me. From his mutilated utterances I gleaned that his name was Mourse, that his home was Cairo, and that I was a nice lady. There was no village in sight but a flock of brown sheep were feeding on the herbage upon the slope near the river, and were being minded by a group of women and some little children who said "How-do, how-do" as I passed by. Coming back the wind was against us and I reached the Beduin in a state of heat and fatigue, and with that sense of virtue that one has after having taken a walk one didn't want to take. The wind fell late in the afternoon and we went a few miles farther down before tying up for the night near Silaileh. Yesterday a sandbar and the bridge at Esneh furnished our chief excitements. The sandbar held us fast for an hour or more and it was amusing to watch the various tactics employed to get us afloat. Once some of the crew took off their turbans, stripped to the waist, went into the river and set their splendid shoulders against the boat (the Beduin herself actually got stuck that time) and pushed. It's queer, but these men look much more undressed without their turbans than without their clothes.At the Esneh bridge we cut loose temporarily from our tug and were warped through, stem first, with ropes, the tug following; and so avoided a repetition of the accident going up. We tied up for the night on the east bank opposite a small town some distance above Erment. Coming down from there this morning it was perfectly lovely. We got here too late to go to church, and I've not been off the boat all day. Doris went this afternoon for a last look at Karnak.Monday, March 10. Our hours here are numbered and I feel as though I couldn't let them go. For some reason it's nice to be departing - for we are really now turning our faces homeward and there are Italy and England to be taken in by the way, but there's so much here that I've not really seen - and the place itself is so hauntingly beautiful. I thank Heaven that mine eyes have seen it. Cousin Theodore and Doris went for one more ride this afternoon, but I had to do the society act for the family  -going out to say good-bye to the teachers at the Mission School, and then to tea with the Contessa. That poor lady, instead of going to Cairo immediately after our departure for Aswan - as she intended - was ill in bed for a week and looks quite shocking. We had a charming time together and tea out in the garden. She says that Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our finds this winter have been the only ones of any importance in this region. The men at the American House (i.e., the Metropolitan Museum diggers) have found nothing but trifles like beads, etc. Lord Carnarvon and his digger - the captious Mr. Howard Carter - have been working like mad for weeks without stopping at all for the weekly holiday, and with a force of 300, and have found nothing. "And Carnarvon bears it", says Mr. Tremaine, who has somehow been completely hypnotized by that degenerate peer, "as only Carnarvon could!” Having lofty souls ourselves we are sorry the others have been unsuccessful, but considering how Howard Carter sneered to us one day about Harry Burton's capacity as a digger, we are too enchanted that it was Harry who made the important finds, and Harry himself is so happy he looks like a different man.Tuesday, March 11. And our last day at Luxor - a perfectly beautiful one like so many, many that have preceded it. Harry came over from the valley quite early to spend the day and make his final report about the diggings which closed down yesterday. He stopped work ad Medinet Habu a week ago, and spent the final week clearing up things in Siphtah where he found alabaster fragments which, when pieced together, made 18 Ushabti! He presently crossed over to Luxor to pick up Cousin Emma and Doris who had gone there, and at luncheon time they had much tittle-tattle to communicate. They had encountered the youngest son of the German Emperor, and Doris was rejoicing that she was not a Royal Prince, if they looked like that - with positively no chin at all. {42}Shortly after luncheon Mr. Lancelot Crane appeared and stayed to tea. He and Harry and Doris and I always have a lot of amusement talking together. Two ladies, acquaintances of Cousin Emma's, just down from Wadi HaIfa on the Mayflower, also came to tea. At intervals during the day I watched the funny performances of the poultry, which amuse me so, and which form such a queer link between this strange and ancient land and the everyday, humble things at home. I really thought the devotion to Sir Francis Drake exhibited by his ladies was carried to excess when he pulled a feather out of himself and one of them instantly swallowed it. The yellow dog was lying contentedly on the sand while two turkeys walked round and round him relieving him of his fleas! And - to my great delight - I saw a wild goose, flying with outstretched neck, between the river and the range. Wednesday, March 12. Dendereh. It's hard to say which was the more beautiful - the dawn I saw this morning at Luxor or the sunset from the top of the temple here. It was a hectic leaving. About eleven we got off, and for two hours before that the sands in our immediate viciitity were dotted with natives come to say good-bye in the hope of a final backshish. Mrs. Winlock and Dorothy Richardson rode over from the American House to bid us farewell. Mohammed Mohassib came in a steam launch and was both pathetic and impressive. He is a great personality. He is planning to take his grandson and go to Mecca later on - for when we and his other foreign friends are gone there will be "no nice people in Luxor, no nice people at all." He says that once when he went to Mecca he took "threeteen" people with him. As we passed the Luxor waterfront on our way down the river many handkerchiefs and scarfs (or is it scarves?) fluttered farewell - friends of the crew, tradesmen we had patronized, and an acquaintance or two. But most of the people we have known at Luxor this winter are already gone. It was so lovely coming down between poppy-covered banks. Have you ever heard of the poppies of Egypt? I never have. By the "Indian billow", yes - but never by the waters of the Nile.       "I strew these opiate flowers        On thy restless pillow;        They were plucked in Orient bowers        By the Indian billow.        May thy sleep be calm and deep        Like theirs who fell - not theirs who weep."White and pink and violet and red they stretched in vast fields and were a joy to look upon.We got here about five and Doris and I immediately started for the temple on foot. Jones said it was a "very short walk" and on this boat a very short walk means not more than ten minutes. But it's a number of years since Jones went to the temple and he had forgotten. It was a good two miles - a beautiful walk - after we had traversed the native village - with the most heavenly evening light over miles and miles of emerald fields among which the road wound. But we got to the temple just in time to see the sunset from the roof. Then there was only time to hurry through the dim recesses of the temple itself, have a moment's glimpse ofthe most important crypt, the colored one, and then start back. When we left the Beduin we had an escort of two sailors - on our return journey we had a retinue of eight - two native men, two children and two goats having joined. One of the native men strode in front of us to shoo off dogs and donkeys and people, and all the rest followed in our wake. Doris and I chuckled consumedly at the idea of our tearing over Africa at nightfall with such a bodyguard. It was again augmented before we reached the boat by two more of the crew who had been sent out to see if anything had happened to us. Here let me say, apropos of the gentleman who preceded us and ruthlessly cleared our path - I never can {43} thoroughly enjoy belonging to the conquering and superior races. I hate to have silent, poor, inoffensive people pushed off the public highway in order to give me three times more room than I need.Thursday, March 13. Nag Hamadi. It has been a perfectly hateful day - with the wind blowing everything and everybody off the face of the earth. We tied up here in the middle of the day because it was too dangerous to go through the drawbridge in such a gale. It is a cold and glittering night. The Mayflower, presumably with Mr. Weston on board, is lying on the other side of the river, waiting for the opening of the bridge in the morning. Friday, March 14. The Nile near Giegole. This has been a great day -one of the best we've had in Egypt. We reached Beliana about eleven I think, and as soon as we could after that we started for Abydos - Doris and Haneen on donkeys, and Amelie and I in a brougham (of all things in the world to drive about Egypt in) with a coronet on the door! Also there was a very gorgeous native policeman on a proud Arabian barb prancing beside us. They say Beliana is a very bad town - and somehow it looked it. The eight mile drive to Abydos is through such beautiful country. As you leave the town there seem to be great estates on either side with fine palm groves. Then come vast fields of grain, green and golden, and reaped and stacked and many flocks and herds, and the abodes of the tribes tending them are out in the broad flat topped stacks of grain! And there was so much joyous young life bounding and cavorting about the fields and on the highway, baby donkeys, baby camels, baby calves and kids and lambs. The temple ofTeli I at Abydos is so surrounded by hills of rubbish that it has the effect of being a sunken one, and the facade is so very ruinous that the splendors of the interior are all the more striking, - the most beautiful carving, it seemed to us, that we've seen in Egypt. We found a Cook's party of about twenty-five having luncheon in the temple, and being starving we promptly had ours, beginning with a libation to the gods as Haneen dropped the water bottle just as we entered. It was delightful wandering about the temple. So much of the roof is gone that much of the place basks in sunlight. We did not go to the other temple - that of Rameses II -because it is a very inferior one, and we didn't want to take too much time. As we were leaving, the onslaught of natives with things to sell and natives who only wanted to beg and everybody yelling at once, and their vanquishing by Amelie, reminded me of a verse in the Psalms "They came about me like flies -and were extinct even as fire among thorns". Again we had the delights of the drive, marred only by a tearing wind. Once our horse shied violently at a Beduin riding by on a camel in the deep ditch by the high road. Our driver explained that the horse disliked the Beduin headdress. As we neared our Beduin on the road by the river we had to make our way through trains of camels laden with bags' of onions which were being unloaded from ghiassas (I don't know how to spell them, but they are the native boats with the Viking prows and enormous sails). We got back in ample time to pull up stakes and make some headway before nightfall.Saturday, March 15. Tied above Abutig. It's been another day spoiled by a tearing wind which destroys all the pleasure of being on deck. Early this morning before we were up we passed Cook's Steamer Amenartis on her way to Aswan, with Emily and Marian Whitney on board. I'm so sorry to have missed them at Luxor. We have passed Akhenim, a very large and flourishing native town, to which, according to tradition, a heathen princess once came riding to desecrate a temple, and the earth opened and swallowed her up. The most beautiful sight today was what looked like the preparing of a caravan to go somewhere into the interior - camels were being loaded with all kinds of strange things and the mingling of colors was quite ravishing. We are getting into the land of colored raiment again instead ofthe black and white of upper Egypt.        Good-bye, dears, much love from        Your devoted Mary {44}Tuesday, March 18.Going down the Nile. Dearest Adeline:- This trip down the Nile, to which we looked forward with such keen pleasure, remembering the rapture of the one up, has been a great disappointment because of the incessant .and violent winds. Cousin Emma has scarcely been on deck at all. The rest of us have spent much time there, but usually with a growing irritation at being blown offthe map, until the point would be reached when one or all of us would leap out of our chairs with an exasperated "I'm going down - this is too much for me." I can't remember whether I finished my last letter Saturday or Sunday. But anyway I did not tell you, did I, about the lovely walk I had just before sunset and just after on Sunday evening? We tied up a little earlier than usual by a lovely bank, and I started out immediately with Amelie and the usual sailors. We took to what Amelie (who knows this country well) called the highroad. It was literally that, being on sort of an embankment with deep ditches on either side. But it was little more than a footpath winding indefinitely through desert stretches, fascinating villages and cultivated fields, and palm trees scattered almost everywhere. It was such a lovely thing to be doing Palm Sunday, and the whole thing looked as I imagine Palestine. Yesterday nothing particular occurred except our stopping at Minya for mail. Doris and I walked to the post office with Jones and sailors and then to the railroad station, thereby seeing the main part of the town, which is a flourishing one but not interesting. Today we spent four or five hours a little below Shekh Fadl while the tug coaled. We were tied to a high and very dull bank, and in four or five hours even the ducks can cease to amuse. Wednesday, March 19. This has been a day. A hideous wind, as usual. Then early this morning we sat on a sandbank for an hour in company with Cook's large steamers, a small steamer and twenty-seven native boats. We were the first to get off and sail away and I suppose they all hated us. For the rest of the day we've played tag with the Arabia and the Rameses III (the two big Cook steamers). They would pass us haughtily, then around a bend in the river we'd find them stuck again and we'd sail by. I don't know how many times that happened. And once when we came upon them stranded and our tug went aground on the same bar for a few minutes, in its frantic struggles to get free it rammed the Rameses, which must have annoyed that monarch greatly. We are tied up tonight about thirty miles from Cairo and a new hat. I hunger and thirst for a new hat. There are no words to express the fatigue that takes possession of me when I don one of my two sun-burned, faded, pinned out, dilapidated head coverings. We are to continue living on the boat for about a week before moving to the Gazireh Palace. It is with a pang that we have today lost sight of the desert, on the edge of which for three months we have lived in a highly civilized and luxurious way - minus, of course, two things that are supposed to go with civilization now. We've not seen a motorcar since leaving Cairo and we couldn't have telephoned anywhere to save our lives!Thursday, March 20. - Cairo. We started a little before six this morning and were lucky enough to make the bridge  just before it closed  after the morning opening. If we'd been ten minutes later we would not have got through until afternoon. The wind kept on with unabated zeal but we found the entrance into the city's environs very interesting. I wonder if custom could stale for me the interest, ever. Our tying up place looks perfectly charming - it's the beauty spot of the bank. Not being here to superintend the planting ourselves, our gardener has got that mixture of everything - purple and red and pink - that the Oriental loves, but the effect is gay and springlike, {45}  the grass is very green, there are a few charming flowering shrubs, a palm tree or two, and the steps cut in the bank to the road above have been greatly improved in quality and looks. The gardener himself is a rather dressy looking person with an obsequious grin which I dislike. His subordinate who does the sprinkling is quite unpleasant to look upon - a fat old party dressed in layers of what would seem to be dirty nightshirts, each one shorter than the one underneath it.We found the flags at half mast and could not learn what for until Jones came back from an expedition into the town and said the poor King of Greece had been murdered.We have - or are to have tomorrow - the same fine, red motorcar we had before. This afternoon we had to use a substitute when Cousin Theodore, Doris and I motored out to Mena House for tea. The pyramids looked much more impressive to me than the last time. By the way, the stories of Reisner's marvelous find in the Sphynx are mere newspaper inventions. Reisner has been exploring in Dongola all winter - excavating, I mean. It's very amusing to watch the people at Mena House arriving from expeditions on donkey back and camel. When Harry comes down from Luxor he and Doris have planned to go to Sakkara by camel. I am invited but an eight mile ride on a camel when I'm not used to that mode oftravel gives me pause. However, I may do it. I'm going to Sakkara, of course somehow.Good Friday. March 21. Doris wasn't feeling well this morning so I went to church alone, conveyed thither in the bright red car. The chauffeur, a Levantine, I should think, had apparently never heard of the English Church, All Saints, but pretended to understand his instructions, with the result that we wandered aimlessly, though rapidly, about for some time. We got there at last in time. It was a nice and simple service. The church was full - loads of men. On the way out I paused at the end of the church to do homage to the small, plain marble tablet in memory of General Gordon. Outside the door I found Mrs. Romeyn and Estelle waiting for me. I had hoped to see them at church, but had looked in vain. I took them to their hotel, the Continental, and got back to the boat just at luncheon time. This afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I motored out into the desert, the beautiful, haunting desert, and then had tea at Heliopolis. Though we were going rather slowly, for a motor car, we flashed all too rapidly for Doris and me through the streets with their fascinating, fascinating sights. Probably there are places in India where there is the same medley of nationalities as here, but I never imagined anything like it. Our hearts warmed to the sound of the pipes and the sight of a Highlander in kilts.        Good-bye, my dears.        Your most devoted Mary March 28, 1913.Ghezireh PalaceDearest Adeline:- The Grand Duchess Constantine and I have been having our clothes made at the same place this week and it has left us little time for our writing. In fact, these past seven days since my last letter have seemed a little too commonplace to be treated in the usual journal way, so I'll give you merely a sort of resume. We moved from the dahabya this morning - it was getting too hot to stay there - and find ourselves in the vast spaces of this palace which once belonged to Ismael. The size of everything is fairly oppressive. Doris and my bedroom is as big as our whole apartment in Orange Street. The bathroom must be thirty feet high (the other rooms of course the same, only it's more apparent in the bathroom) and nailed on the wall, by way of decoration, is a fan whose sticks are a yard long. All through the Palace there are the most superb {46} mirrors - mirrors everywhere. Ismail's vanity must have been colossal if he liked to see himself at every tum, because his portrait, hanging in the dining salon, is anything but seductive. Our table in said salon is directly next that of the Grand Duke Constantine and their interest in us is much more open than we condescend to let ours in them appear. Tonight at dinner, though they had guests, the Grand Duke kept turning around and staring at us. They evidently knew who Cousin Theodore was. The Grand Duchess looks nice and simple and is very jolly in spite of her fresh mourning for the King of Greece. But the Duke has a fishy eye and a sinister cast of countenance. I wouldn't care to know him but I'd like very much to meet the Duchess, which I have not done, though the opening sentence of this letter might lead you to suppose that we toddled hand in hand to the tailor's. We were much amused watching the people in the dining room tonight. Really Englishwomen are, this year, even more eccentric than Americans in their coiffures. Mrs. Aylmer, wife of Col. Aylmer, came to dinner in a peacock blue satin bathing cap with rhinestones all around the edge. I wish I had the nerve to do that sort ofthing and then I could stop agonizing over my hair. We truly have done little worth recording this week. It has been very warm - we've had errands to do which have taken time, and when we've simply gone for a drive in the motorcar it has been to no place in particular.Saturday morning. I'm wondering if you can read this at all - it's written so horribly. I don't know what's got into my penmanship.Last Sunday being Easter, Doris and I took the precaution of going to church three-quarters of an hour early, and a steady stream of people was entering then. We sat on the side aisle and on the wall before us was a marble tablet Sacred to the Memory of the Riflemen of the 3rd Batallion of the King's Royal Rifles, with its three divisions - Killed in Action, Died of Wounds, and - by far the longest list - Died of Sickness. That seemed to me the most pathetic from its lack of glory, though there may have been quite as much heroism in connection with it as in either of the other two. The church was packed to bursting, and never have those beloved words "Christ is risen from the dead and become the first fiuits ofthem that slept" thrilled me more than in this alien land where the cross with its few thousands towers above the crescent and its millions.Tuesday morning Harry came down from Luxor and that evening he took Doris and me to the Torchlight Tattoo at the Kaar-el-nil parade ground. It was quite a splendid spectacle. I enclose the programme and beg you of your courtesy to keep it for me. All the performances took place in an immense hollow square, three sides of which were outlined by two hundred Gordon Highlanders each holding a torch. I must confess that the "Grand Military Fantasia - The Battle of Minden" was anything but impressive. I've seen infinitely better sham fights in a Wild West Show. But the rest of it was fine. And" Abide with me" played with a continuous roll of drums for an undertone was one of the most effective things I ever heard. I caught a glimpse of my Russian Princess looking lovelier than ever.Wednesday morning we all went to the Museum and I was enchanted to find that it was as though scales had fallen from my eyes. Things that had no meaning to me before we went up the river were packed with it this time.Thursday afternoon Cousin Emma, Doris and Harry went to Shepheard's Hotel and from a balcony witnessed the procession - the bridal procession of the Khedive's daughter. It was short but magnificent. Of course the bride was wholly invisible, being hermetically sealed in a superb mahogany and gold coach with pinky-red velvet hangings, and drawn by six {47} mahogany colored horses with pinky-red harness and trappings. Native military bands, splendid to look upon, but "Allah be obeyed! How infernally they played!" Soldiers and gun carriages and an absolutely ineffectual band of native police who failed entirely to clear the streets for the progress.I'm finishing this Saturday evening. Doris and Harry are intolerably set up because the Grand Duchess smiled at them not once but twice this afternoon. We've all decided we like her very much but not her august husband. He looks as though he could burn people at the stake and enjoy doing it.        Goodnight, dears, and love always from        Your MarySunday night. March 30.Ghezireh Palace, Cairo Dearest Adeline:- (As I hate paper that opens backwards, I'm writing on this wrong side before.) It has been a heavenly day, such a relief from yesterday, which was what the knowing call "Khamsing". That, briefly described, means a dead, thick feeling in the air which has a most deplorable effect on the nerves. I tried to make myself believe yesterday that I was homesick, but I wasn't - I was merely in a villainous temper, wanting to bite everybody's head off and then have a crocodile bite mine. But it rained a little in the evening and today has been fresh and delicious. Harry and I went to church in the morning and the fine looking soldier boy who was usher hid us behind a pillar so that we saw nothing and the clangor from the street prevented us from hearing anything - which proves one advantage of knowing your service by heart. Mr. Bonham Carter joined us on the way out and we walked to the Hotel Angleterre to see if Miss Elena Rathbone had arrived from India. She hadn't, so Harry and I hopped into a humble vehicle and drove home. In the afternoon he and Doris went to the Zoo in the hope of seeing Lord Kitchener, who is supposed to haunt the place Sunday afternoon. He skipped today but they had many other delights, including baby lions, and a baby elephant which marched in front of a band of Scotiish pipers. And they had tea on a tiny island surrounded on all sides by flamingoes and pelicans and came home in a joyous frame of mind. In the meantime we had had a charming call from Mr. Anthony, an Englishman in the Department of Finance, who liked our tea so much that he drank three cups.Monday. March 31. Had I ever guessed the wild delight of riding a camel, never would I have wasted a whole winter on the lowly and diminutive donkey. Today we went to Sakkara and back -twenty miles in all - on camels, and though I'm very sore in spots tonight it was a blissful experience. We had an early breakfast - Doris, Harry and I -and then motored out to Mena House, where camels and luncheon had been ordered for us. Lady Hilda Keppel, a charming Englishwoman we've met here, went with us, so we felt almost like a camel corps. The one thing I had dreaded was the getting up of the beast, but I was spared the immediate terrors of anticipation, because the instant I touched the saddle, before I had had time to arrange my legs or anything, Mena heaved his mighty bulk into the air and I went up shrieking. Later on as we were loping over the desert, the exhilaration of it went to my head and I shouted from my eminence to Doris's "I never was so happy in my life." It took us two hours and a half to get there, and though we were starving to death we heroically did two tombs and a pyramid before going to the rest house and unpacking our lunch basket. We had no time for dawdling, so, luncheon over, we started immediately for the Serapeum. {48}I think, in a way, that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt. Those enormous subterranean passages, those incredible titanic sarcophagi of granite, the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it all, in order that the sacred bulls should be fittingly buried! Certainly they were an extraordinary people, those ancients of Egypt. We finished our sightseeing with the tomb of Thir, where I got so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel as a haven of rest. Then we mounted, had our photographs taken, and turned our faces homeward. It took us just two hours to return and when we got to Mena House at six we drank quarts of tea. We asked the waiter when the next train would leave for Cairo and he replied "The next train has gone!" So we telephoned for a motor and got back just in time to dress for our eight o'clock dinner. The wonders of Sakkara are very great, but in my memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the desert under that vast, vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of snowy cloud, the sweet, wild wind in our faces and the effects of light and of drifting cloud - shadow things of indescribable beauty.Tuesday, April 1. Cousin Theodore had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to the dentist's and had it out. He suffered so horribly a year ago because he didn't have a tooth out, that we didn't delay it on this occasion for fear he would change his mind. The news of Mr. J. P. Morgan's death came this morning.Cairo is bursting into bloom as befits the time of year. The flowering trees are something ecstatic. We have one in the gardens of this place that is a dream of beauty. I think it's a kind of magnolia - a very large tree with small blossoms. This afternoon Cousin Emma and I left cards on Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay, and on Mrs. Grahame; an Englishwoman whose husband is one of the officials here, and then I came back to the hotel for the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to tea. It was so nice to see them. We had tea in the great hall which was once the scene of an atrocious crime. This palace was the one Ismail built for the Empress Eugenie to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal. After that he had it for one of his own royal abodes. He had a foster brother who was supposed to be his closest friend and his dearest one. He took him to drive one day and, on their return, as they entered the great hall, guards seized the foster brother and killed him there while that unspeakable beast, Ismail, strolled up the marble staircase as though nothing were happening. After tea, Mr. Hine, the manager, took us through the Casino. It is so unattractive on the outside that I had never taken the trouble to go in, little imagining the splendors of the interior. But it seems it was a part of the royal harem and many of the old furnishings are still there, and it is really regal. After we'd seen that I got a carriage and took the Whitneys to the Beduin as they never had seen the inside of a dahabya. They graciously said they found it even more interesting than a royal palace. They wanted me to go back with them to dine at their hotel, but I couldn't. Wednesday, April 2. The birds in the gardens about this place are legion. At night you can hear the mewing owls and a lovely call in a chord of two notes that I'm told is made by a charming little plover that flies in pairs after dark. Early in the morning all kinds of birds begin shouting madly, and when we are dressing sometimes a dashing black or gray crow sits on the railing of our balcony cawing forcibly at us and waiting for us to leave the room so that he may fly in and carry off things from the dressing table. And today when Doris and I passed through the salon of this suite, two sparrows were sitting facing each other in two gilt framed, yellow brocaded chairs. They fly in and out as they list. We all five of us motored about in a more or less aimless fashion this morning. And once the Khedive flashed by us like a flame in his car. This afternoon Cousin Theodore, Harry {49} and I motored out to Mena House for tea, and on the way we saw a quite horrid sight. The sidewalk in front of a handsome house was drenched with blood, and a dead buffalo was just being dragged away by the heels. Neither Cousin Theodore nor Harry knew what it meant, but I did, having just read about the custom in a book called "Veiled Women". It's one of their pleasing little marriage ceremonies when a bride enters her new home to cut the throat of a live buffalo in front of her at gateway or door.This must go in its unfinished condition. These are such crowded days, and such beautiful ones - the air goes to my head like wine.Much love to you all. My next will probably be posted at Naples.        Your devoted        Mary. April 11. S. S. Prince HeinrichThe MediterraneanDearest Adeline:- I'm not sure about the number of this letter but it's next to the one I stopped abruptly last week.Our winter in Egypt is a thing of the past, but with spring in Italy and England before us, and Home after that, we go on our way rejoicing in spite of certain regrets and the fact that camels have dropped out of our lives "it may be for years and it may be forever". Chief among my regrets are the following:        I did not see Lord Kitchener        I did not see a polo game        I saw no dervishes. While we were at Luxor there was some sort of a function that brought the dervishes to Cairo, and they lay in the street while their sheik rode over them on horseback. We read about it in the papers. Certainly some of the spectacles in Egypt are lurid ones, and I thank Heaven I belong to the Anglo-Saxon race. Doris and Harry saw a sight the day we went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which haply escaped me as we flashed by in the motor car, and that was children prisoners in chains. I should think Lord Kitchener would "advise" the Khedive to discontinue that practice. However, I suppose it takes time for even a giant like Kitchener to correct all of the worst abuses in a land so packed with them. That expedition to the Tombs of the Caliphs I hug to my memory with special delight because we came near not seeing them and it would have been such a loss. They make, on the outskirts of Cairo and close to the edge of the desert, a little city of their own crowned with beautiful domes and exquisite minarets, and are so wrapped in sunshine and loveliness that there is no thought of gloom. That same day we went to see a mosque whose name no one could remember and the guide books were all packed. But it's the second largest one in the world and is a beauty, with its hundreds of columns built around a large and arid court in the center ofwhich is a well and one tree. The two principal things that are pointed out to you are the granite column and a magic stone. The granite column came to the mosque all by itself from Mecca. And the stone is possessed of healing properties so that when the Faithful have aches in their tummies they go and lick the stone till their tongues bleed. They've licked a deep groove in the stone and the whole thing looks quite horrid. Lord Kitchener must have"advised" the stopping of that rite, because recently an iron grating has been put in front of the stone. {50} During the last week in Cairo there was a little social flavoring mixed in with shopping, sightseeing and the daily round. I lunched one day with the Contessa and Mr. Tremayne at the Continental, and Mr. Tremayne, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out a little wad of paper, said "Here, Mrs. Newberry, is an antique I've been carrying about for weeks meaning to give you" and there was a heavenly bit of the perfect Egyptian blue with the sacred eye or Horus on it - the very thing I had hunted for in vain in the shops at Luxor. I've had it set in a ring and it's fascinating.Various people came to call, among them Watson Pasha, a Personage indeed in Egypt, being the Khedive's one English aide. I was out the afternoon he came but I met him a day or two after at a tea at the Grahames and found him a most delightful person. Lean and tanned and simple and direct and amusing. So tanned that if it were not for the clear cut, clean English features he might easily have been taken for a native. The King of Siam did take him for one. He had been sent to meet that potentate and escort him through the Suez Canal. Major Watson was wearing the uniform of the Egyptian Army and as His Majesty of Siam shook hands with him he said "I hope it is perhaps that you speak a few words of English". As he told me this story he was taking his amber cigarette holder from a gold case. "That is the most sumptuous thing I ever saw" I said. "Wait!" said he and brought out a gold cigarette case and a gold matchbox. "Backshish" he explained. "They can't give me money so they give me these things and I'd so much rather have a check for a thousand pounds!"The Grahames' place is one of the sweetest I've ever seen, such lovely gardens, such beautiful trees, - a fresh proof of the truth of what I've always said that the English have a genius for taking England with them wherever they go. We had tea on the verandah, and black and grey crows were waiting close. by, until we should turn our backs, to steal the cakes.Our last evening in Cairo was a dream of beauty with the slenderest thread of a new moon floating above a towering auracaria in the garden. The Ghezireh people must have been glad to have us go  -they'd been keeping the hotel open just for us and closed it when we left. Mr. Backler, the manager of Shepheard's and the Ghezireh, sent his own motorcar to help convey us to the station as a parting compliment to Cousin Theodore. Various people were at the station to see us off, including seven of the crew of the Beduin, all there were left in Cairo, the others having scattered. They all shook all our hands three separate times and my friend Mohommed, the second captain, looked perfectly superb. We left Cairo at 9:45 and for three hours and a quarter our train sped through lovely scenes. We sailed at two that afternoon and the infinite boredom of seafaring has soaked to the marrow of my bones. There are a lot of awfully good looking men on board and if I knew some of them it might relieve my ennui - but the voyage is too short for making acquaintances. There are three Les Altesses, one of whom has a face like a Japanese mask and blows his nose so deafeningly and oft that I'm in constant fear that Cousin Theodore will speak to him about it. But the Prince and Princess Radziwill (I can't spell it) look the part quite satisfyingly. It has been a polar sea today instead of a summer one. I do so hope we shall find a little warmth in Italy. We expect to arrive in Naples at noon tomorrow.        Heaven bless you all, my dears.        Devotedly, Mary P.S. Saturday A.M. Last evening I represented the family at the Ship's Concert while Cousin Theodore, Doris and Harry were playing cards in the smoking room. At a table near them sat the Japanese Mask and the Radziwills talking to each other in six different languages. The Japanese mask blew his nose and Cousin Theodore bounded in his chair, turned and glared at him and said "Good Heavens!" in a loud voice. Then the Japanese mask began spouting pages of Virgil; that {51} over, to relax their minds their Highnesses began asking conundrums of each other in English. The first one was too improper for me to record. Then Prince Radziwill said "Why is Sir William Frazer like a flannel petticoat?" the answer to which was "Because he shrinks from washing." When Doris' and Harry's heads went down on the table in gasps of laughter, Princess R. said in a shocked tone "Oh! those people understood!" We have found out that the Japanese mask is a son of the great Blucher.We are in sight of Naples, and it's cold and raining like anything. But am I such a poor thing as to grumble at a rainy day when I’ve had four months of gorgeous sunshine?        M.

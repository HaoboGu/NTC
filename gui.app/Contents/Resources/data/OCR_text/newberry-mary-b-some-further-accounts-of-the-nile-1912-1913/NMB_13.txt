 ~. D<lrling Gopher -Your letter of Jan 16th cnme h,'o or three d;,ys :tgo ,,'ith its nccounts of the Pr.om. It \,'as u\Vfully nice for you, ;tS ~ \"ell ns for her, that Edith made such <I hit. I judge from What you n~t others hAve written that this yenr's Prom w~s more per-fervid th"n pn~ 
that ever WDS before. It's a pity to let it become nn ins~lne orgy ≠thnt will eventufllly kill it. It v,'HS quite notie of you to '''rite to m so soon and shen you were still so nevrly dend with fntigue. I enclo the order on the bank which you asked for, nnd I put in the P.S. just just to remind you not to absent-mindedly cnrry off the key. 

On \Yednc sday Do ris I. nd I hfJ done o:r the pI e~' sant cho cks of our live s "-'hen tI bOllt dre\~ up beside the Beduin nnd deposited Hr. Dodge "nd Jnnet. None of our Clcvel.. nd letters hnd mentioned th,∑t they \\'ere coming pbro,∑d so it wns Dn absolute surprise. They had corne up the river on the R~meses III, nnd left for Aswnn the next dny, but they nre to be here for D week on their return. I went over to the Rnmeses to callan Mrs. Dodge. I think she was quite cross because neither Pnige nor HO"'urd Eells hnd wri tten me they "'ere corning. 
Tuesday Doris pnd I hod n lovely time. Harry hod invited us to come ovet to the vnlley so as to show us the tomb of Horemheh and me the sarcophngus in Siphtuh, and then to have luncheon With him at the House. We had breakfast an hour eurlier than usunl, lind then started ofr on our donkeys with our aonkey boys and a sailor as escort, and Jones to rollow us soon as he hud got Cousin Theodore started for the dny. We rode along the river's edge as far 8S the ferry landing place directly opposit! Luxor, before turning toward the R;)nge. The ferry landing th"t morning "'us "'orth going miles to see. Two ste<lmers had come up the night berore and scores upon scores of people ,'nd donkeys ;:lnd s<tndc~'rts ~,nd c;lrri?ges hnd corne "cross to take some of the numerous expeditions on this side. The gay trappings or the donkeys, the blue and white clothes or the donkey boys with a dash of red on their chests nIl made fine coloring; seven native policemen in Khaki, with their carnes waiting for them in the background, the bustle and conrusion nnd everybody yelling nt once -it \,'as all immensely enterttlining to me. It was a perfectly delicious dny, like nIl our dnys, und I did enjoy the ride. The light nrid color on the Libyan Rnnge as ~e netlred it were more ffir>rvellous thnn nnything I've ever seen, -surpassingly beautiful, but so blinding we hRd to pull down our chifon veils. The tombs ~ere intensely interesting, especinlly tho: p;,intings on the ,,'aIls of Horemheh. The unfinished p,lrt interested me even more thnn the beauty of the completed work;-it was just ps thoug the urtist -dead thous<!nds or ye,lrs ago -h~ld lr~id do\om his pencil :.nd brushes to go home to luncheon. Our luncheon D.t the House ,,'ith H~.rry and Hr. Cliane v,'as a very j.olly ;lfrai-r;-~!nd ~lt three \,e st<Jrted for home, getting back at teatime and finding the dnhnbyn seething with people. 
One other day this week I was invited by the Contessn Contnrdone to go 
t.o }5;arnak."'ith <J s!U"ll ∑pDrty, of ,,'hom the Russian Princess Gortschokoff was one. Karnak is alwtlys one of the most,~onderful-plndes in the world, but that afternoon it was secondary in my eyes to the Princess with whom I fell madly in love. Think or a Princess -a renl one -like those i~ novels and storybooks; young, lithe, beautiful, f~scinRting, quiet and absolutely simple in her m'lnner. I couldn't keep my eyes off her. J\'e watched the workman excavatin a large and bec1utiful jar clnd hoped it would be packed with jewels, but when it Was emptied nothing but <J brick materi~llized. \,'e paid D. visit to the uncanny goddess Sekmet, she with the lion's head. It is a lire-sized statue of black grnnite which stands in a dusky room in the temple of Ptah, lighted only b~ a small squRre Window high up in the roof. When you've looked at the creature for rive minutes. she seems so alive th,lt you sympathize with the Arabs who believe that she sometimes prowls forth and ents people. 
Endless love, dearest, from Your l'lim. 
I long to see you. I don't know how I can WRit till June. Are you c~ming to any definite decision as to whether you will go to Utoh or not next summer? I had a letter from Mr. Wnlcott that shocked me grently. 
He said thnt when Charlie wus broueht home in December they did not iq 1 expect him to live more than six weeks; but thnt now there seemed n ~~ good ch;;nce of his recovery. 
My love to Jock and Wilson

 On the Nile somewhere between Roda and Asyut, and about 180 miles from Cairo. DAHf\BYA BEDUIN EGyPT 
Darling Gopher -This is the best pa.per nnd I sh:,ll not use it often in writing to you, but am giving you a treat as long DS this is my first letter to you from the boat. I'd give anything if you were here. It is impossible to convey by written description any adequDte iden of t incomparable river "nd the scenes through ','hich it winds. And ho,,"' it v;inds! \\'e almost ïïï the compnss in our meandering. And it would t<1ke n whole day's writing, and result in a letter you would cnrry about with you -possibly -but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of scenery. The principal towns ore on the west shore, rInd it is on thnt shore thnt the railroad from Cniro to Luxor runs, and there is enough of ceDseless interest on th.. t side to hold you spellbound 110m the cool early morning through the glowing doy tothe moonlit dusk. But it's no≠thing to the' Eastern Shore with its desert stretches, its cultjY<lted str≠and terrl1ces, its pDlm groves, its native villDges so absolutely f~sci≠nating thnt eDch one fills me with delight, some of them are walled nbou and those I1h~HYS have towering palms growing \\'ithin the \\'nlls; the unw;;llled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert s'tnd out of which they rise and the desert hills i~to which they melt without one specJ~ of <.Inything green about them. And ell\l'l1Ys on th;~t m~'gic Epstern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, sometimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground. ~b≠solutely bleak and bare, of the strangest sh~pes, long stretches of them where surely no humnn foot has ever been, then long stretches where they hnve been quarried for buiJding stone, or tunnelled for tombs. Yesterd~y morning we sailed close to the foot of gigantic limestone cli1fs th~t rose precipitously out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that carne rolling llnd crvshi to the water's edge to be loaded on barges. The sunlight on this scene made a blinding glare. Ang the people -the picturesque people -no 5 stretch so barren but that you CD,n alwpys see t.hose stntely shrouded figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, f~shing, sitting motion≠less~broodi~g by the river, prnying With their fnces to the Enst, women 
fill~ng the1r wnter jars and striding up the bnnk with the full jnrs on. their he,1 d ~, d i sd a ining to touch them even with one h;! nd, people g01nf and COm1ng along the rand -on foot, on donkeys, on camels (nlw"v~ 
carne s and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the shore shepherded-!. by one or two cloaked and hooded figure~. And on the river itself grent barges loaded with cotton, with grain, with water jars p~cked so thnt they look like crenm colored cannon b~lls, _ or merely bo~ts filled witl 
pe0 pIe, but e!l c h n nd everyernftcarr ying the 1 ;1 teen s H iI, sohe ~l utif u in its s"'cep even ....∑hen its canvas is ;1 crnzy mass of tAtters. 
We are almost criminally comfortable, and systemRticnlly over-fed _ Or "'ould be if we ate fill that ....,ns set before us. The Beduin drftws anI 14 inches of water, and being towed, slides forward with such n totni absence of motion that if it were not for the scenery slipping by we w not know we were moving at nIl. There are 22 people on bonrd just to take care of us four. We tie up every night anywhere we h;.ppen to be at sunset. The tying-up process is as follows. We dnl\\' up to the bank. One of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder ~nd ..... 0 rrie sit intothe saneï Tw0 0 f the ere....∑ c Cl r ry huge wooden pins ,I sb as hitching posts, ashore and two more of the crew armed with mnllets m<Jde of sections of tree trunk hammer the pins into the s;lnd <Jnd we ~'r tied to those. Jones is always armed in case we are lying nenr n nnti Village that might be inclined to depredations. 
We hope to reach Asyut tonight where there ought to be much mail await 
ing us, and where this will be posted. We do not expect to re~ch Luxo 
till the 21st at the earliest. Goodbye for now my Darling. It's a month today since we sailed Dnd this is my 4th letter to you besides pst cards. I shall be very anxious to hear how you are after your lit operation, so don't fnil to carry out the instructions I sent you in rn last about having someone write me at once. 
God bless my boy 
With all my love 
Your 11im

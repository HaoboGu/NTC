Everyone went out to Saqqare this morning except Lellie Parsons and myself. About 4 o’clock it began to look rather threatening - and in a few momenta the rain case in torrents. 1 never caw it rain more
furiously for a little while. Great excitement on the boat - all hands

' !>
to take refuge below, while the deck was quickly dismantled and every-
v*
thing put under canvass. I was uncomfortable about our people - as 1 saw the Cook party from the Kamesis arriving in bedraggled condition.
But they came home dry, having taken refuge under cover, it has rained at intervals sines - is wanner - the cloud scenery after the heavy storm was wonderful. Our boat did not leak in the slightest degree.

The Lul el Nil, came along an hour after - and tomorrow we will all gp by rail to the Fayum - returning the same day. This will not of course give us time to see much. But the Greek Inn at Medina is impossible, and we could not see our way to doing the whole thing, much as we would like to see it, as we should be obliged to carry a camp outfit and spend three or four days there. High wind tonight and we are rolling a good deal.

Theodore made the acquaintance of an unknown Englishman who has lived there for 10 years - and he says one can drive quite comfortably to the pyramids of Hawara and Illahun. home by 5 o'clock tired and glad. Fine evening affects returning across the desert. The ,reydum pyramid touched to radiance by the setting sun, while all ebout was grey and dark.

It waa the announcement that Ramadan begins tomorrow, the new moon having shown herself last night, 1 hope she will bring us warmer weather, it is a pleasure to look forward to the lovely nights she brings. The wind has been cold all day - and there is a penetrating cold tonight. We have the little stove lighted and placed in the hall. 37° last night.

sand flying in clouds. They took one of the large sail boats, and with the Reis of the steamer and several of the sailors started, not returning until we had nearly finished dinner. They reported that they wore * not only able to sail up to the rock of Abusir, but 3 miles beyond.

man of artistic proclivities. They became violently attached and eloped9 - the eon remained with the father, the daughter went with
the mother. After some time the original husband died, and Mr* and

Mrs. Benson married. They are now in reduced circumstances - the

daughter chiefly supporting them. She is a writer of some reputation made her first success with "Kismet" a story of the Kile. Mrs. Benson

is said to havs been very beautiful - one would not now think it - she is infirm and crippled from rheumatism, and was run over by a oarriage sometime since, and almost killed - one eye being entirely destroyed. It was piteous to sse these two old people (for the daughter we did not see) devotedly attached to each other, amongst their beautiful tilings, so shut away from the world, and striving to keep their heads above water. Mrs. Costello had told Theodore that Benson would occasionally soil some of hie possessions, when he was prtssed for the necessities of life - and that seme er hir friends ^ul* ©ceesionelly
